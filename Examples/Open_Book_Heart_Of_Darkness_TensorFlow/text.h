"The Nellie, a cruising yawl,",
"swung to her anchor without a",
"flutter of the sails, and was at",
"rest. The flood had made, the",
"wind was nearly calm, and being",
"bound down the river, the only",
"thing for it was to come to and",
"wait for the turn of the tide.",
"The sea-reach of the Thames",
"stretched before us like the",
"beginning of an interminable",
"waterway. In the offing the sea",
"and the sky were welded together",
"without a joint, and in the",
"luminous space the tanned sails",
"of the barges drifting up with",
"the tide seemed to stand still in",
"red clusters of canvas sharply",
"peaked, with gleams of varnished",
"sprits. A haze rested on the low",
"shores that ran out to sea in",
"vanishing flatness. The air was",
"dark above Gravesend, and farther",
"back still seemed condensed into",
"a mournful gloom, brooding",
"motionless over the biggest, and",
"the greatest, town on earth.",
"The Director of Companies was our",
"captain and our host. We four",
"affectionately watched his back",
"as he stood in the bows looking",
"to seaward. On the whole river",
"there was nothing that looked",
"half so nautical. He resembled a",
"pilot, which to a seaman is",
"trustworthiness personified. It",
"was difficult to realize his work",
"was not out there in the luminous",
"estuary, but behind him, within",
"the brooding gloom.",
"Between us there was, as I have",
"already said somewhere, the bond",
"of the sea. Besides holding our",
"hearts together through long",
"periods of separation, it had the",
"effect of making us tolerant of",
"each other's yarns—and even",
"convictions. The Lawyer—the best",
"of old fellows—had, because of",
"his many years and many virtues,",
"the only cushion on deck, and was",
"lying on the only rug. The",
"Accountant had brought out",
"already a box of dominoes, and",
"was toying architecturally with",
"the bones. Marlow sat",
"cross-legged right aft, leaning",
"against the mizzen-mast. He had",
"sunken cheeks, a yellow",
"complexion, a straight back, an",
"ascetic aspect, and, with his",
"arms dropped, the palms of hands",
"outwards, resembled an idol. The",
"director, satisfied the anchor",
"had good hold, made his way aft",
"and sat down amongst us. We",
"exchanged a few words lazily.",
"Afterwards there was silence on",
"board the yacht. For some reason",
"or other we did not begin that",
"game of dominoes. We felt",
"meditative, and fit for nothing",
"but placid staring. The day was",
"ending in a serenity of still and",
"exquisite brilliance. The water",
"shone pacifically; the sky,",
"without a speck, was a benign",
"immensity of unstained light; the",
"very mist on the Essex marsh was",
"like a gauzy and radiant fabric,",
"hung from the wooded rises",
"inland, and draping the low",
"shores in diaphanous folds. Only",
"the gloom to the west, brooding",
"over the upper reaches, became",
"more sombre every minute, as if",
"angered by the approach of the",
"sun.",
"And at last, in its curved and",
"imperceptible fall, the sun sank",
"low, and from glowing white",
"changed to a dull red without",
"rays and without heat, as if",
"about to go out suddenly,",
"stricken to death by the touch of",
"that gloom brooding over a crowd",
"of men.",
"Forthwith a change came over the",
"waters, and the serenity became",
"less brilliant but more profound.",
"The old river in its broad reach",
"rested unruffled at the decline",
"of day, after ages of good",
"service done to the race that",
"peopled its banks, spread out in",
"the tranquil dignity of a",
"waterway leading to the uttermost",
"ends of the earth. We looked at",
"the venerable stream not in the",
"vivid flush of a short day that",
"comes and departs for ever, but",
"in the august light of abiding",
"memories. And indeed nothing is",
"easier for a man who has, as the",
"phrase goes, “followed the sea”",
"with reverence and affection,",
"than to evoke the great spirit of",
"the past upon the lower reaches",
"of the Thames. The tidal current",
"runs to and fro in its unceasing",
"service, crowded with memories of",
"men and ships it had borne to the",
"rest of home or to the battles of",
"the sea. It had known and served",
"all the men of whom the nation is",
"proud, from Sir Francis Drake to",
"Sir John Franklin, knights all,",
"titled and untitled—the great",
"knights-errant of the sea. It had",
"borne all the ships whose names",
"are like jewels flashing in the",
"night of time, from the Golden",
"Hind returning with her rotund",
"flanks full of treasure, to be",
"visited by the Queen's Highness",
"and thus pass out of the gigantic",
"tale, to the Erebus and Terror,",
"bound on other conquests—and that",
"never returned. It had known the",
"ships and the men. They had",
"sailed from Deptford, from",
"Greenwich, from Erith—the",
"adventurers and the settlers;",
"kings' ships and the ships of men",
"on 'Change; captains, admirals,",
"the dark “interlopers” of the",
"Eastern trade, and the",
"commissioned “generals” of East",
"India fleets. Hunters for gold or",
"pursuers of fame, they all had",
"gone out on that stream, bearing",
"the sword, and often the torch,",
"messengers of the might within",
"the land, bearers of a spark from",
"the sacred fire. What greatness",
"had not floated on the ebb of",
"that river into the mystery of an",
"unknown earth!... The dreams of",
"men, the seed of commonwealths,",
"the germs of empires.",
"The sun set; the dusk fell on the",
"stream, and lights began to",
"appear along the shore. The",
"Chapman light-house, a",
"three-legged thing erect on a",
"mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights",
"of ships moved in the fairway—a",
"great stir of lights going up and",
"going down. And farther west on",
"the upper reaches the place of",
"the monstrous town was still",
"marked ominously on the sky, a",
"brooding gloom in sunshine, a",
"lurid glare under the stars.",
"“And this also,” said Marlow",
"suddenly, “has been one of the",
"dark places of the earth.”",
"He was the only man of us who",
"still “followed the sea.” The",
"worst that could be said of him",
"was that he did not represent his",
"class. He was a seaman, but he",
"was a wanderer, too, while most",
"seamen lead, if one may so",
"express it, a sedentary life.",
"Their minds are of the",
"stay-at-home order, and their",
"home is always with them—the",
"ship; and so is their country—the",
"sea. One ship is very much like",
"another, and the sea is always",
"the same. In the immutability of",
"their surroundings the foreign",
"shores, the foreign faces, the",
"changing immensity of life, glide",
"past, veiled not by a sense of",
"mystery but by a slightly",
"disdainful ignorance; for there",
"is nothing mysterious to a seaman",
"unless it be the sea itself,",
"which is the mistress of his",
"existence and as inscrutable as",
"Destiny. For the rest, after his",
"hours of work, a casual stroll or",
"a casual spree on shore suffices",
"to unfold for him the secret of a",
"whole continent, and generally he",
"finds the secret not worth",
"knowing. The yarns of seamen have",
"a direct simplicity, the whole",
"meaning of which lies within the",
"shell of a cracked nut. But",
"Marlow was not typical (if his",
"propensity to spin yarns be",
"excepted), and to him the meaning",
"of an episode was not inside like",
"a kernel but outside, enveloping",
"the tale which brought it out",
"only as a glow brings out a haze,",
"in the likeness of one of these",
"misty halos that sometimes are",
"made visible by the spectral",
"illumination of moonshine.",
"His remark did not seem at all",
"surprising. It was just like",
"Marlow. It was accepted in",
"silence. No one took the trouble",
"to grunt even; and presently he",
"said, very slow—“I was thinking",
"of very old times, when the",
"Romans first came here, nineteen",
"hundred years ago—the other day",
".... Light came out of this river",
"since—you say Knights? Yes; but",
"it is like a running blaze on a",
"plain, like a flash of lightning",
"in the clouds. We live in the",
"flicker—may it last as long as",
"the old earth keeps rolling! But",
"darkness was here yesterday.",
"Imagine the feelings of a",
"commander of a fine—what d'ye",
"call 'em?—trireme in the",
"Mediterranean, ordered suddenly",
"to the north; run overland across",
"the Gauls in a hurry; put in",
"charge of one of these craft the",
"legionaries—a wonderful lot of",
"handy men they must have been,",
"too—used to build, apparently by",
"the hundred, in a month or two,",
"if we may believe what we read.",
"Imagine him here—the very end of",
"the world, a sea the colour of",
"lead, a sky the colour of smoke,",
"a kind of ship about as rigid as",
"a concertina—and going up this",
"river with stores, or orders, or",
"what you like. Sand-banks,",
"marshes, forests,",
"savages,—precious little to eat",
"fit for a civilized man, nothing",
"but Thames water to drink. No",
"Falernian wine here, no going",
"ashore. Here and there a military",
"camp lost in a wilderness, like a",
"needle in a bundle of hay—cold,",
"fog, tempests, disease, exile,",
"and death—death skulking in the",
"air, in the water, in the bush.",
"They must have been dying like",
"flies here. Oh, yes—he did it.",
"Did it very well, too, no doubt,",
"and without thinking much about",
"it either, except afterwards to",
"brag of what he had gone through",
"in his time, perhaps. They were",
"men enough to face the darkness.",
"And perhaps he was cheered by",
"keeping his eye on a chance of",
"promotion to the fleet at Ravenna",
"by and by, if he had good friends",
"in Rome and survived the awful",
"climate. Or think of a decent",
"young citizen in a toga—perhaps",
"too much dice, you know—coming",
"out here in the train of some",
"prefect, or tax-gatherer, or",
"trader even, to mend his",
"fortunes. Land in a swamp, march",
"through the woods, and in some",
"inland post feel the savagery,",
"the utter savagery, had closed",
"round him—all that mysterious",
"life of the wilderness that stirs",
"in the forest, in the jungles, in",
"the hearts of wild men. There's",
"no initiation either into such",
"mysteries. He has to live in the",
"midst of the incomprehensible,",
"which is also detestable. And it",
"has a fascination, too, that goes",
"to work upon him. The fascination",
"of the abomination—you know,",
"imagine the growing regrets, the",
"longing to escape, the powerless",
"disgust, the surrender, the",
"hate.”",
"He paused.",
"“Mind,” he began again, lifting",
"one arm from the elbow, the palm",
"of the hand outwards, so that,",
"with his legs folded before him,",
"he had the pose of a Buddha",
"preaching in European clothes and",
"without a lotus-flower—“Mind,",
"none of us would feel exactly",
"like this. What saves us is",
"efficiency—the devotion to",
"efficiency. But these chaps were",
"not much account, really. They",
"were no colonists; their",
"administration was merely a",
"squeeze, and nothing more, I",
"suspect. They were conquerors,",
"and for that you want only brute",
"force—nothing to boast of, when",
"you have it, since your strength",
"is just an accident arising from",
"the weakness of others. They",
"grabbed what they could get for",
"the sake of what was to be got.",
"It was just robbery with",
"violence, aggravated murder on a",
"great scale, and men going at it",
"blind—as is very proper for those",
"who tackle a darkness. The",
"conquest of the earth, which",
"mostly means the taking it away",
"from those who have a different",
"complexion or slightly flatter",
"noses than ourselves, is not a",
"pretty thing when you look into",
"it too much. What redeems it is",
"the idea only. An idea at the",
"back of it; not a sentimental",
"pretence but an idea; and an",
"unselfish belief in the",
"idea—something you can set up,",
"and bow down before, and offer a",
"sacrifice to....”",
"He broke off. Flames glided in",
"the river, small green flames,",
"red flames, white flames,",
"pursuing, overtaking, joining,",
"crossing each other—then",
"separating slowly or hastily. The",
"traffic of the great city went on",
"in the deepening night upon the",
"sleepless river. We looked on,",
"waiting patiently—there was",
"nothing else to do till the end",
"of the flood; but it was only",
"after a long silence, when he",
"said, in a hesitating voice, “I",
"suppose you fellows remember I",
"did once turn fresh-water sailor",
"for a bit,” that we knew we were",
"fated, before the ebb began to",
"run, to hear about one of",
"Marlow's inconclusive",
"experiences.",
"“I don't want to bother you much",
"with what happened to me",
"personally,” he began, showing in",
"this remark the weakness of many",
"tellers of tales who seem so",
"often unaware of what their",
"audience would like best to hear;",
"“yet to understand the effect of",
"it on me you ought to know how I",
"got out there, what I saw, how I",
"went up that river to the place",
"where I first met the poor chap.",
"It was the farthest point of",
"navigation and the culminating",
"point of my experience. It seemed",
"somehow to throw a kind of light",
"on everything about me—and into",
"my thoughts. It was sombre",
"enough, too—and pitiful—not",
"extraordinary in any way—not very",
"clear either. No, not very clear.",
"And yet it seemed to throw a kind",
"of light.",
"“I had then, as you remember,",
"just returned to London after a",
"lot of Indian Ocean, Pacific,",
"China Seas—a regular dose of the",
"East—six years or so, and I was",
"loafing about, hindering you",
"fellows in your work and invading",
"your homes, just as though I had",
"got a heavenly mission to",
"civilize you. It was very fine",
"for a time, but after a bit I did",
"get tired of resting. Then I",
"began to look for a ship—I should",
"think the hardest work on earth.",
"But the ships wouldn't even look",
"at me. And I got tired of that",
"game, too.",
"“Now when I was a little chap I",
"had a passion for maps. I would",
"look for hours at South America,",
"or Africa, or Australia, and lose",
"myself in all the glories of",
"exploration. At that time there",
"were many blank spaces on the",
"earth, and when I saw one that",
"looked particularly inviting on a",
"map (but they all look that) I",
"would put my finger on it and",
"say, 'When I grow up I will go",
"there.' The North Pole was one of",
"these places, I remember. Well, I",
"haven't been there yet, and shall",
"not try now. The glamour's off.",
"Other places were scattered about",
"the hemispheres. I have been in",
"some of them, and... well, we",
"won't talk about that. But there",
"was one yet—the biggest, the most",
"blank, so to speak—that I had a",
"hankering after.",
"“True, by this time it was not a",
"blank space any more. It had got",
"filled since my boyhood with",
"rivers and lakes and names. It",
"had ceased to be a blank space of",
"delightful mystery—a white patch",
"for a boy to dream gloriously",
"over. It had become a place of",
"darkness. But there was in it one",
"river especially, a mighty big",
"river, that you could see on the",
"map, resembling an immense snake",
"uncoiled, with its head in the",
"sea, its body at rest curving",
"afar over a vast country, and its",
"tail lost in the depths of the",
"land. And as I looked at the map",
"of it in a shop-window, it",
"fascinated me as a snake would a",
"bird—a silly little bird. Then I",
"remembered there was a big",
"concern, a Company for trade on",
"that river. Dash it all! I",
"thought to myself, they can't",
"trade without using some kind of",
"craft on that lot of fresh",
"water—steamboats! Why shouldn't I",
"try to get charge of one? I went",
"on along Fleet Street, but could",
"not shake off the idea. The snake",
"had charmed me.",
"“You understand it was a",
"Continental concern, that Trading",
"society; but I have a lot of",
"relations living on the",
"Continent, because it's cheap and",
"not so nasty as it looks, they",
"say.",
"“I am sorry to own I began to",
"worry them. This was already a",
"fresh departure for me. I was not",
"used to get things that way, you",
"know. I always went my own road",
"and on my own legs where I had a",
"mind to go. I wouldn't have",
"believed it of myself; but,",
"then—you see—I felt somehow I",
"must get there by hook or by",
"crook. So I worried them. The men",
"said 'My dear fellow,' and did",
"nothing. Then—would you believe",
"it?—I tried the women. I, Charlie",
"Marlow, set the women to work—to",
"get a job. Heavens! Well, you",
"see, the notion drove me. I had",
"an aunt, a dear enthusiastic",
"soul. She wrote: 'It will be",
"delightful. I am ready to do",
"anything, anything for you. It is",
"a glorious idea. I know the wife",
"of a very high personage in the",
"Administration, and also a man",
"who has lots of influence with,'",
"etc. She was determined to make",
"no end of fuss to get me",
"appointed skipper of a river",
"steamboat, if such was my fancy.",
"“I got my appointment—of course;",
"and I got it very quick. It",
"appears the Company had received",
"news that one of their captains",
"had been killed in a scuffle with",
"the natives. This was my chance,",
"and it made me the more anxious",
"to go. It was only months and",
"months afterwards, when I made",
"the attempt to recover what was",
"left of the body, that I heard",
"the original quarrel arose from a",
"misunderstanding about some hens.",
"Yes, two black hens.",
"Fresleven—that was the fellow's",
"name, a Dane—thought himself",
"wronged somehow in the bargain,",
"so he went ashore and started to",
"hammer the chief of the village",
"with a stick. Oh, it didn't",
"surprise me in the least to hear",
"this, and at the same time to be",
"told that Fresleven was the",
"gentlest, quietest creature that",
"ever walked on two legs. No doubt",
"he was; but he had been a couple",
"of years already out there",
"engaged in the noble cause, you",
"know, and he probably felt the",
"need at last of asserting his",
"self-respect in some way.",
"Therefore he whacked the old",
"nigger mercilessly, while a big",
"crowd of his people watched him,",
"thunderstruck, till some man—I",
"was told the chief's son—in",
"desperation at hearing the old",
"chap yell, made a tentative jab",
"with a spear at the white man—and",
"of course it went quite easy",
"between the shoulder-blades. Then",
"the whole population cleared into",
"the forest, expecting all kinds",
"of calamities to happen, while,",
"on the other hand, the steamer",
"Fresleven commanded left also in",
"a bad panic, in charge of the",
"engineer, I believe. Afterwards",
"nobody seemed to trouble much",
"about Fresleven's remains, till I",
"got out and stepped into his",
"shoes. I couldn't let it rest,",
"though; but when an opportunity",
"offered at last to meet my",
"predecessor, the grass growing",
"through his ribs was tall enough",
"to hide his bones. They were all",
"there. The supernatural being had",
"not been touched after he fell.",
"And the village was deserted, the",
"huts gaped black, rotting, all",
"askew within the fallen",
"enclosures. A calamity had come",
"to it, sure enough. The people",
"had vanished. Mad terror had",
"scattered them, men, women, and",
"children, through the bush, and",
"they had never returned. What",
"became of the hens I don't know",
"either. I should think the cause",
"of progress got them, anyhow.",
"However, through this glorious",
"affair I got my appointment,",
"before I had fairly begun to hope",
"for it.",
"“I flew around like mad to get",
"ready, and before forty-eight",
"hours I was crossing the Channel",
"to show myself to my employers,",
"and sign the contract. In a very",
"few hours I arrived in a city",
"that always makes me think of a",
"whited sepulchre. Prejudice no",
"doubt. I had no difficulty in",
"finding the Company's offices. It",
"was the biggest thing in the",
"town, and everybody I met was",
"full of it. They were going to",
"run an over-sea empire, and make",
"no end of coin by trade.",
"“A narrow and deserted street in",
"deep shadow, high houses,",
"innumerable windows with venetian",
"blinds, a dead silence, grass",
"sprouting between the stones,",
"imposing carriage archways right",
"and left, immense double doors",
"standing ponderously ajar. I",
"slipped through one of these",
"cracks, went up a swept and",
"ungarnished staircase, as arid as",
"a desert, and opened the first",
"door I came to. Two women, one",
"fat and the other slim, sat on",
"straw-bottomed chairs, knitting",
"black wool. The slim one got up",
"and walked straight at me—still",
"knitting with downcast eyes—and",
"only just as I began to think of",
"getting out of her way, as you",
"would for a somnambulist, stood",
"still, and looked up. Her dress",
"was as plain as an",
"umbrella-cover, and she turned",
"round without a word and preceded",
"me into a waiting-room. I gave my",
"name, and looked about. Deal",
"table in the middle, plain chairs",
"all round the walls, on one end a",
"large shining map, marked with",
"all the colours of a rainbow.",
"There was a vast amount of",
"red—good to see at any time,",
"because one knows that some real",
"work is done in there, a deuce of",
"a lot of blue, a little green,",
"smears of orange, and, on the",
"East Coast, a purple patch, to",
"show where the jolly pioneers of",
"progress drink the jolly",
"lager-beer. However, I wasn't",
"going into any of these. I was",
"going into the yellow. Dead in",
"the centre. And the river was",
"there—fascinating—deadly—like a",
"snake. Ough! A door opened, a",
"white-haired secretarial head,",
"but wearing a compassionate",
"expression, appeared, and a",
"skinny forefinger beckoned me",
"into the sanctuary. Its light was",
"dim, and a heavy writing-desk",
"squatted in the middle. From",
"behind that structure came out an",
"impression of pale plumpness in a",
"frock-coat. The great man",
"himself. He was five feet six, I",
"should judge, and had his grip on",
"the handle-end of ever so many",
"millions. He shook hands, I",
"fancy, murmured vaguely, was",
"satisfied with my French. Bon",
"Voyage.",
"“In about forty-five seconds I",
"found myself again in the",
"waiting-room with the",
"compassionate secretary, who,",
"full of desolation and sympathy,",
"made me sign some document. I",
"believe I undertook amongst other",
"things not to disclose any trade",
"secrets. Well, I am not going to.",
"“I began to feel slightly uneasy.",
"You know I am not used to such",
"ceremonies, and there was",
"something ominous in the",
"atmosphere. It was just as though",
"I had been let into some",
"conspiracy—I don't know—something",
"not quite right; and I was glad",
"to get out. In the outer room the",
"two women knitted black wool",
"feverishly. People were arriving,",
"and the younger one was walking",
"back and forth introducing them.",
"The old one sat on her chair. Her",
"flat cloth slippers were propped",
"up on a foot-warmer, and a cat",
"reposed on her lap. She wore a",
"starched white affair on her",
"head, had a wart on one cheek,",
"and silver-rimmed spectacles hung",
"on the tip of her nose. She",
"glanced at me above the glasses.",
"The swift and indifferent",
"placidity of that look troubled",
"me. Two youths with foolish and",
"cheery countenances were being",
"piloted over, and she threw at",
"them the same quick glance of",
"unconcerned wisdom. She seemed to",
"know all about them and about me,",
"too. An eerie feeling came over",
"me. She seemed uncanny and",
"fateful. Often far away there I",
"thought of these two, guarding",
"the door of Darkness, knitting",
"black wool as for a warm pall,",
"one introducing, introducing",
"continuously to the unknown, the",
"other scrutinizing the cheery and",
"foolish faces with unconcerned",
"old eyes. Ave! Old knitter of",
"black wool. Morituri te salutant.",
"Not many of those she looked at",
"ever saw her again—not half, by a",
"long way.",
"“There was yet a visit to the",
"doctor. 'A simple formality,'",
"assured me the secretary, with an",
"air of taking an immense part in",
"all my sorrows. Accordingly a",
"young chap wearing his hat over",
"the left eyebrow, some clerk I",
"suppose—there must have been",
"clerks in the business, though",
"the house was as still as a house",
"in a city of the dead—came from",
"somewhere up-stairs, and led me",
"forth. He was shabby and",
"careless, with inkstains on the",
"sleeves of his jacket, and his",
"cravat was large and billowy,",
"under a chin shaped like the toe",
"of an old boot. It was a little",
"too early for the doctor, so I",
"proposed a drink, and thereupon",
"he developed a vein of joviality.",
"As we sat over our vermouths he",
"glorified the Company's business,",
"and by and by I expressed",
"casually my surprise at him not",
"going out there. He became very",
"cool and collected all at once.",
"'I am not such a fool as I look,",
"quoth Plato to his disciples,' he",
"said sententiously, emptied his",
"glass with great resolution, and",
"we rose.",
"“The old doctor felt my pulse,",
"evidently thinking of something",
"else the while. 'Good, good for",
"there,' he mumbled, and then with",
"a certain eagerness asked me",
"whether I would let him measure",
"my head. Rather surprised, I said",
"Yes, when he produced a thing",
"like calipers and got the",
"dimensions back and front and",
"every way, taking notes",
"carefully. He was an unshaven",
"little man in a threadbare coat",
"like a gaberdine, with his feet",
"in slippers, and I thought him a",
"harmless fool. 'I always ask",
"leave, in the interests of",
"science, to measure the crania of",
"those going out there,' he said.",
"'And when they come back, too?' I",
"asked. 'Oh, I never see them,' he",
"remarked; 'and, moreover, the",
"changes take place inside, you",
"know.' He smiled, as if at some",
"quiet joke. 'So you are going out",
"there. Famous. Interesting, too.'",
"He gave me a searching glance,",
"and made another note. 'Ever any",
"madness in your family?' he",
"asked, in a matter-of-fact tone.",
"I felt very annoyed. 'Is that",
"question in the interests of",
"science, too?' 'It would be,' he",
"said, without taking notice of my",
"irritation, 'interesting for",
"science to watch the mental",
"changes of individuals, on the",
"spot, but...' 'Are you an",
"alienist?' I interrupted. 'Every",
"doctor should be—a little,'",
"answered that original,",
"imperturbably. 'I have a little",
"theory which you messieurs who go",
"out there must help me to prove.",
"This is my share in the",
"advantages my country shall reap",
"from the possession of such a",
"magnificent dependency. The mere",
"wealth I leave to others. Pardon",
"my questions, but you are the",
"first Englishman coming under my",
"observation...' I hastened to",
"assure him I was not in the least",
"typical. 'If I were,' said I, 'I",
"wouldn't be talking like this",
"with you.' 'What you say is",
"rather profound, and probably",
"erroneous,' he said, with a",
"laugh. 'Avoid irritation more",
"than exposure to the sun. Adieu.",
"How do you English say, eh?",
"Good-bye. Ah! Good-bye. Adieu. In",
"the tropics one must before",
"everything keep calm.'... He",
"lifted a warning forefinger....",
"'Du calme, du calme.'",
"“One thing more remained to",
"do—say good-bye to my excellent",
"aunt. I found her triumphant. I",
"had a cup of tea—the last decent",
"cup of tea for many days—and in a",
"room that most soothingly looked",
"just as you would expect a lady's",
"drawing-room to look, we had a",
"long quiet chat by the fireside.",
"In the course of these",
"confidences it became quite plain",
"to me I had been represented to",
"the wife of the high dignitary,",
"and goodness knows to how many",
"more people besides, as an",
"exceptional and gifted creature—a",
"piece of good fortune for the",
"Company—a man you don't get hold",
"of every day. Good heavens! and I",
"was going to take charge of a",
"two-penny-half-penny",
"river-steamboat with a penny",
"whistle attached! It appeared,",
"however, I was also one of the",
"Workers, with a capital—you know.",
"Something like an emissary of",
"light, something like a lower",
"sort of apostle. There had been a",
"lot of such rot let loose in",
"print and talk just about that",
"time, and the excellent woman,",
"living right in the rush of all",
"that humbug, got carried off her",
"feet. She talked about 'weaning",
"those ignorant millions from",
"their horrid ways,' till, upon my",
"word, she made me quite",
"uncomfortable. I ventured to hint",
"that the Company was run for",
"profit.",
"“'You forget, dear Charlie, that",
"the labourer is worthy of his",
"hire,' she said, brightly. It's",
"queer how out of touch with truth",
"women are. They live in a world",
"of their own, and there has never",
"been anything like it, and never",
"can be. It is too beautiful",
"altogether, and if they were to",
"set it up it would go to pieces",
"before the first sunset. Some",
"confounded fact we men have been",
"living contentedly with ever",
"since the day of creation would",
"start up and knock the whole",
"thing over.",
"“After this I got embraced, told",
"to wear flannel, be sure to write",
"often, and so on—and I left. In",
"the street—I don't know why—a",
"queer feeling came to me that I",
"was an imposter. Odd thing that",
"I, who used to clear out for any",
"part of the world at twenty-four",
"hours' notice, with less thought",
"than most men give to the",
"crossing of a street, had a",
"moment—I won't say of hesitation,",
"but of startled pause, before",
"this commonplace affair. The best",
"way I can explain it to you is by",
"saying that, for a second or two,",
"I felt as though, instead of",
"going to the centre of a",
"continent, I were about to set",
"off for the centre of the earth.",
"“I left in a French steamer, and",
"she called in every blamed port",
"they have out there, for, as far",
"as I could see, the sole purpose",
"of landing soldiers and",
"custom-house officers. I watched",
"the coast. Watching a coast as it",
"slips by the ship is like",
"thinking about an enigma. There",
"it is before you—smiling,",
"frowning, inviting, grand, mean,",
"insipid, or savage, and always",
"mute with an air of whispering,",
"'Come and find out.' This one was",
"almost featureless, as if still",
"in the making, with an aspect of",
"monotonous grimness. The edge of",
"a colossal jungle, so dark-green",
"as to be almost black, fringed",
"with white surf, ran straight,",
"like a ruled line, far, far away",
"along a blue sea whose glitter",
"was blurred by a creeping mist.",
"The sun was fierce, the land",
"seemed to glisten and drip with",
"steam. Here and there",
"greyish-whitish specks showed up",
"clustered inside the white surf,",
"with a flag flying above them",
"perhaps. Settlements some",
"centuries old, and still no",
"bigger than pinheads on the",
"untouched expanse of their",
"background. We pounded along,",
"stopped, landed soldiers; went",
"on, landed custom-house clerks to",
"levy toll in what looked like a",
"God-forsaken wilderness, with a",
"tin shed and a flag-pole lost in",
"it; landed more soldiers—to take",
"care of the custom-house clerks,",
"presumably. Some, I heard, got",
"drowned in the surf; but whether",
"they did or not, nobody seemed",
"particularly to care. They were",
"just flung out there, and on we",
"went. Every day the coast looked",
"the same, as though we had not",
"moved; but we passed various",
"places—trading places—with names",
"like Gran' Bassam, Little Popo;",
"names that seemed to belong to",
"some sordid farce acted in front",
"of a sinister back-cloth. The",
"idleness of a passenger, my",
"isolation amongst all these men",
"with whom I had no point of",
"contact, the oily and languid",
"sea, the uniform sombreness of",
"the coast, seemed to keep me away",
"from the truth of things, within",
"the toil of a mournful and",
"senseless delusion. The voice of",
"the surf heard now and then was a",
"positive pleasure, like the",
"speech of a brother. It was",
"something natural, that had its",
"reason, that had a meaning. Now",
"and then a boat from the shore",
"gave one a momentary contact with",
"reality. It was paddled by black",
"fellows. You could see from afar",
"the white of their eyeballs",
"glistening. They shouted, sang;",
"their bodies streamed with",
"perspiration; they had faces like",
"grotesque masks—these chaps; but",
"they had bone, muscle, a wild",
"vitality, an intense energy of",
"movement, that was as natural and",
"true as the surf along their",
"coast. They wanted no excuse for",
"being there. They were a great",
"comfort to look at. For a time I",
"would feel I belonged still to a",
"world of straightforward facts;",
"but the feeling would not last",
"long. Something would turn up to",
"scare it away. Once, I remember,",
"we came upon a man-of-war",
"anchored off the coast. There",
"wasn't even a shed there, and she",
"was shelling the bush. It appears",
"the French had one of their wars",
"going on thereabouts. Her ensign",
"dropped limp like a rag; the",
"muzzles of the long six-inch guns",
"stuck out all over the low hull;",
"the greasy, slimy swell swung her",
"up lazily and let her down,",
"swaying her thin masts. In the",
"empty immensity of earth, sky,",
"and water, there she was,",
"incomprehensible, firing into a",
"continent. Pop, would go one of",
"the six-inch guns; a small flame",
"would dart and vanish, a little",
"white smoke would disappear, a",
"tiny projectile would give a",
"feeble screech—and nothing",
"happened. Nothing could happen.",
"There was a touch of insanity in",
"the proceeding, a sense of",
"lugubrious drollery in the sight;",
"and it was not dissipated by",
"somebody on board assuring me",
"earnestly there was a camp of",
"natives—he called them",
"enemies!—hidden out of sight",
"somewhere.",
"“We gave her her letters (I heard",
"the men in that lonely ship were",
"dying of fever at the rate of",
"three a day) and went on. We",
"called at some more places with",
"farcical names, where the merry",
"dance of death and trade goes on",
"in a still and earthy atmosphere",
"as of an overheated catacomb; all",
"along the formless coast bordered",
"by dangerous surf, as if Nature",
"herself had tried to ward off",
"intruders; in and out of rivers,",
"streams of death in life, whose",
"banks were rotting into mud,",
"whose waters, thickened into",
"slime, invaded the contorted",
"mangroves, that seemed to writhe",
"at us in the extremity of an",
"impotent despair. Nowhere did we",
"stop long enough to get a",
"particularized impression, but",
"the general sense of vague and",
"oppressive wonder grew upon me.",
"It was like a weary pilgrimage",
"amongst hints for nightmares.",
"“It was upward of thirty days",
"before I saw the mouth of the big",
"river. We anchored off the seat",
"of the government. But my work",
"would not begin till some two",
"hundred miles farther on. So as",
"soon as I could I made a start",
"for a place thirty miles higher",
"up.",
"“I had my passage on a little",
"sea-going steamer. Her captain",
"was a Swede, and knowing me for a",
"seaman, invited me on the bridge.",
"He was a young man, lean, fair,",
"and morose, with lanky hair and a",
"shuffling gait. As we left the",
"miserable little wharf, he tossed",
"his head contemptuously at the",
"shore. 'Been living there?' he",
"asked. I said, 'Yes.' 'Fine lot",
"these government chaps—are they",
"not?' he went on, speaking",
"English with great precision and",
"considerable bitterness. 'It is",
"funny what some people will do",
"for a few francs a month. I",
"wonder what becomes of that kind",
"when it goes upcountry?' I said",
"to him I expected to see that",
"soon. 'So-o-o!' he exclaimed. He",
"shuffled athwart, keeping one eye",
"ahead vigilantly. 'Don't be too",
"sure,' he continued. 'The other",
"day I took up a man who hanged",
"himself on the road. He was a",
"Swede, too.' 'Hanged himself!",
"Why, in God's name?' I cried. He",
"kept on looking out watchfully.",
"'Who knows? The sun too much for",
"him, or the country perhaps.'",
"“At last we opened a reach. A",
"rocky cliff appeared, mounds of",
"turned-up earth by the shore,",
"houses on a hill, others with",
"iron roofs, amongst a waste of",
"excavations, or hanging to the",
"declivity. A continuous noise of",
"the rapids above hovered over",
"this scene of inhabited",
"devastation. A lot of people,",
"mostly black and naked, moved",
"about like ants. A jetty",
"projected into the river. A",
"blinding sunlight drowned all",
"this at times in a sudden",
"recrudescence of glare. 'There's",
"your Company's station,' said the",
"Swede, pointing to three wooden",
"barrack-like structures on the",
"rocky slope. 'I will send your",
"things up. Four boxes did you",
"say? So. Farewell.'",
"“I came upon a boiler wallowing",
"in the grass, then found a path",
"leading up the hill. It turned",
"aside for the boulders, and also",
"for an undersized railway-truck",
"lying there on its back with its",
"wheels in the air. One was off.",
"The thing looked as dead as the",
"carcass of some animal. I came",
"upon more pieces of decaying",
"machinery, a stack of rusty",
"rails. To the left a clump of",
"trees made a shady spot, where",
"dark things seemed to stir",
"feebly. I blinked, the path was",
"steep. A horn tooted to the",
"right, and I saw the black people",
"run. A heavy and dull detonation",
"shook the ground, a puff of smoke",
"came out of the cliff, and that",
"was all. No change appeared on",
"the face of the rock. They were",
"building a railway. The cliff was",
"not in the way or anything; but",
"this objectless blasting was all",
"the work going on.",
"“A slight clinking behind me made",
"me turn my head. Six black men",
"advanced in a file, toiling up",
"the path. They walked erect and",
"slow, balancing small baskets",
"full of earth on their heads, and",
"the clink kept time with their",
"footsteps. Black rags were wound",
"round their loins, and the short",
"ends behind waggled to and fro",
"like tails. I could see every",
"rib, the joints of their limbs",
"were like knots in a rope; each",
"had an iron collar on his neck,",
"and all were connected together",
"with a chain whose bights swung",
"between them, rhythmically",
"clinking. Another report from the",
"cliff made me think suddenly of",
"that ship of war I had seen",
"firing into a continent. It was",
"the same kind of ominous voice;",
"but these men could by no stretch",
"of imagination be called enemies.",
"They were called criminals, and",
"the outraged law, like the",
"bursting shells, had come to",
"them, an insoluble mystery from",
"the sea. All their meagre breasts",
"panted together, the violently",
"dilated nostrils quivered, the",
"eyes stared stonily uphill. They",
"passed me within six inches,",
"without a glance, with that",
"complete, deathlike indifference",
"of unhappy savages. Behind this",
"raw matter one of the reclaimed,",
"the product of the new forces at",
"work, strolled despondently,",
"carrying a rifle by its middle.",
"He had a uniform jacket with one",
"button off, and seeing a white",
"man on the path, hoisted his",
"weapon to his shoulder with",
"alacrity. This was simple",
"prudence, white men being so much",
"alike at a distance that he could",
"not tell who I might be. He was",
"speedily reassured, and with a",
"large, white, rascally grin, and",
"a glance at his charge, seemed to",
"take me into partnership in his",
"exalted trust. After all, I also",
"was a part of the great cause of",
"these high and just proceedings.",
"“Instead of going up, I turned",
"and descended to the left. My",
"idea was to let that chain-gang",
"get out of sight before I climbed",
"the hill. You know I am not",
"particularly tender; I've had to",
"strike and to fend off. I've had",
"to resist and to attack",
"sometimes—that's only one way of",
"resisting—without counting the",
"exact cost, according to the",
"demands of such sort of life as I",
"had blundered into. I've seen the",
"devil of violence, and the devil",
"of greed, and the devil of hot",
"desire; but, by all the stars!",
"these were strong, lusty,",
"red-eyed devils, that swayed and",
"drove men—men, I tell you. But as",
"I stood on this hillside, I",
"foresaw that in the blinding",
"sunshine of that land I would",
"become acquainted with a flabby,",
"pretending, weak-eyed devil of a",
"rapacious and pitiless folly. How",
"insidious he could be, too, I was",
"only to find out several months",
"later and a thousand miles",
"farther. For a moment I stood",
"appalled, as though by a warning.",
"Finally I descended the hill,",
"obliquely, towards the trees I",
"had seen.",
"“I avoided a vast artificial hole",
"somebody had been digging on the",
"slope, the purpose of which I",
"found it impossible to divine. It",
"wasn't a quarry or a sandpit,",
"anyhow. It was just a hole. It",
"might have been connected with",
"the philanthropic desire of",
"giving the criminals something to",
"do. I don't know. Then I nearly",
"fell into a very narrow ravine,",
"almost no more than a scar in the",
"hillside. I discovered that a lot",
"of imported drainage-pipes for",
"the settlement had been tumbled",
"in there. There wasn't one that",
"was not broken. It was a wanton",
"smash-up. At last I got under the",
"trees. My purpose was to stroll",
"into the shade for a moment; but",
"no sooner within than it seemed",
"to me I had stepped into the",
"gloomy circle of some Inferno.",
"The rapids were near, and an",
"uninterrupted, uniform, headlong,",
"rushing noise filled the mournful",
"stillness of the grove, where not",
"a breath stirred, not a leaf",
"moved, with a mysterious sound—as",
"though the tearing pace of the",
"launched earth had suddenly",
"become audible.",
"“Black shapes crouched, lay, sat",
"between the trees leaning against",
"the trunks, clinging to the",
"earth, half coming out, half",
"effaced within the dim light, in",
"all the attitudes of pain,",
"abandonment, and despair. Another",
"mine on the cliff went off,",
"followed by a slight shudder of",
"the soil under my feet. The work",
"was going on. The work! And this",
"was the place where some of the",
"helpers had withdrawn to die.",
"“They were dying slowly—it was",
"very clear. They were not",
"enemies, they were not criminals,",
"they were nothing earthly",
"now—nothing but black shadows of",
"disease and starvation, lying",
"confusedly in the greenish gloom.",
"Brought from all the recesses of",
"the coast in all the legality of",
"time contracts, lost in",
"uncongenial surroundings, fed on",
"unfamiliar food, they sickened,",
"became inefficient, and were then",
"allowed to crawl away and rest.",
"These moribund shapes were free",
"as air—and nearly as thin. I",
"began to distinguish the gleam of",
"the eyes under the trees. Then,",
"glancing down, I saw a face near",
"my hand. The black bones reclined",
"at full length with one shoulder",
"against the tree, and slowly the",
"eyelids rose and the sunken eyes",
"looked up at me, enormous and",
"vacant, a kind of blind, white",
"flicker in the depths of the",
"orbs, which died out slowly. The",
"man seemed young—almost a boy—but",
"you know with them it's hard to",
"tell. I found nothing else to do",
"but to offer him one of my good",
"Swede's ship's biscuits I had in",
"my pocket. The fingers closed",
"slowly on it and held—there was",
"no other movement and no other",
"glance. He had tied a bit of",
"white worsted round his neck—Why?",
"Where did he get it? Was it a",
"badge—an ornament—a charm—a",
"propitiatory act? Was there any",
"idea at all connected with it? It",
"looked startling round his black",
"neck, this bit of white thread",
"from beyond the seas.",
"“Near the same tree two more",
"bundles of acute angles sat with",
"their legs drawn up. One, with",
"his chin propped on his knees,",
"stared at nothing, in an",
"intolerable and appalling manner:",
"his brother phantom rested its",
"forehead, as if overcome with a",
"great weariness; and all about",
"others were scattered in every",
"pose of contorted collapse, as in",
"some picture of a massacre or a",
"pestilence. While I stood",
"horror-struck, one of these",
"creatures rose to his hands and",
"knees, and went off on all-fours",
"towards the river to drink. He",
"lapped out of his hand, then sat",
"up in the sunlight, crossing his",
"shins in front of him, and after",
"a time let his woolly head fall",
"on his breastbone.",
"“I didn't want any more loitering",
"in the shade, and I made haste",
"towards the station. When near",
"the buildings I met a white man,",
"in such an unexpected elegance of",
"get-up that in the first moment I",
"took him for a sort of vision. I",
"saw a high starched collar, white",
"cuffs, a light alpaca jacket,",
"snowy trousers, a clean necktie,",
"and varnished boots. No hat. Hair",
"parted, brushed, oiled, under a",
"green-lined parasol held in a big",
"white hand. He was amazing, and",
"had a penholder behind his ear.",
"“I shook hands with this miracle,",
"and I learned he was the",
"Company's chief accountant, and",
"that all the book-keeping was",
"done at this station. He had come",
"out for a moment, he said, 'to",
"get a breath of fresh air. The",
"expression sounded wonderfully",
"odd, with its suggestion of",
"sedentary desk-life. I wouldn't",
"have mentioned the fellow to you",
"at all, only it was from his lips",
"that I first heard the name of",
"the man who is so indissolubly",
"connected with the memories of",
"that time. Moreover, I respected",
"the fellow. Yes; I respected his",
"collars, his vast cuffs, his",
"brushed hair. His appearance was",
"certainly that of a hairdresser's",
"dummy; but in the great",
"demoralization of the land he",
"kept up his appearance. That's",
"backbone. His starched collars",
"and got-up shirt-fronts were",
"achievements of character. He had",
"been out nearly three years; and,",
"later, I could not help asking",
"him how he managed to sport such",
"linen. He had just the faintest",
"blush, and said modestly, 'I've",
"been teaching one of the native",
"women about the station. It was",
"difficult. She had a distaste for",
"the work.' Thus this man had",
"verily accomplished something.",
"And he was devoted to his books,",
"which were in apple-pie order.",
"“Everything else in the station",
"was in a muddle—heads, things,",
"buildings. Strings of dusty",
"niggers with splay feet arrived",
"and departed; a stream of",
"manufactured goods, rubbishy",
"cottons, beads, and brass-wire",
"sent into the depths of darkness,",
"and in return came a precious",
"trickle of ivory.",
"“I had to wait in the station for",
"ten days—an eternity. I lived in",
"a hut in the yard, but to be out",
"of the chaos I would sometimes",
"get into the accountant's office.",
"It was built of horizontal",
"planks, and so badly put together",
"that, as he bent over his high",
"desk, he was barred from neck to",
"heels with narrow strips of",
"sunlight. There was no need to",
"open the big shutter to see. It",
"was hot there, too; big flies",
"buzzed fiendishly, and did not",
"sting, but stabbed. I sat",
"generally on the floor, while, of",
"faultless appearance (and even",
"slightly scented), perching on a",
"high stool, he wrote, he wrote.",
"Sometimes he stood up for",
"exercise. When a truckle-bed with",
"a sick man (some invalid agent",
"from upcountry) was put in there,",
"he exhibited a gentle annoyance.",
"'The groans of this sick person,'",
"he said, 'distract my attention.",
"And without that it is extremely",
"difficult to guard against",
"clerical errors in this climate.'",
"“One day he remarked, without",
"lifting his head, 'In the",
"interior you will no doubt meet",
"Mr. Kurtz.' On my asking who Mr.",
"Kurtz was, he said he was a",
"first-class agent; and seeing my",
"disappointment at this",
"information, he added slowly,",
"laying down his pen, 'He is a",
"very remarkable person.' Further",
"questions elicited from him that",
"Mr. Kurtz was at present in",
"charge of a trading-post, a very",
"important one, in the true",
"ivory-country, at 'the very",
"bottom of there. Sends in as much",
"ivory as all the others put",
"together...' He began to write",
"again. The sick man was too ill",
"to groan. The flies buzzed in a",
"great peace.",
"“Suddenly there was a growing",
"murmur of voices and a great",
"tramping of feet. A caravan had",
"come in. A violent babble of",
"uncouth sounds burst out on the",
"other side of the planks. All the",
"carriers were speaking together,",
"and in the midst of the uproar",
"the lamentable voice of the chief",
"agent was heard 'giving it up'",
"tearfully for the twentieth time",
"that day.... He rose slowly.",
"'What a frightful row,' he said.",
"He crossed the room gently to",
"look at the sick man, and",
"returning, said to me, 'He does",
"not hear.' 'What! Dead?' I asked,",
"startled. 'No, not yet,' he",
"answered, with great composure.",
"Then, alluding with a toss of the",
"head to the tumult in the",
"station-yard, 'When one has got",
"to make correct entries, one",
"comes to hate those savages—hate",
"them to the death.' He remained",
"thoughtful for a moment. 'When",
"you see Mr. Kurtz' he went on,",
"'tell him from me that everything",
"here'—he glanced at the deck—' is",
"very satisfactory. I don't like",
"to write to him—with those",
"messengers of ours you never know",
"who may get hold of your",
"letter—at that Central Station.'",
"He stared at me for a moment with",
"his mild, bulging eyes. 'Oh, he",
"will go far, very far,' he began",
"again. 'He will be a somebody in",
"the Administration before long.",
"They, above—the Council in",
"Europe, you know—mean him to be.'",
"“He turned to his work. The noise",
"outside had ceased, and presently",
"in going out I stopped at the",
"door. In the steady buzz of flies",
"the homeward-bound agent was",
"lying finished and insensible;",
"the other, bent over his books,",
"was making correct entries of",
"perfectly correct transactions;",
"and fifty feet below the doorstep",
"I could see the still tree-tops",
"of the grove of death.",
"“Next day I left that station at",
"last, with a caravan of sixty",
"men, for a two-hundred-mile",
"tramp.",
"“No use telling you much about",
"that. Paths, paths, everywhere; a",
"stamped-in network of paths",
"spreading over the empty land,",
"through the long grass, through",
"burnt grass, through thickets,",
"down and up chilly ravines, up",
"and down stony hills ablaze with",
"heat; and a solitude, a solitude,",
"nobody, not a hut. The population",
"had cleared out a long time ago.",
"Well, if a lot of mysterious",
"niggers armed with all kinds of",
"fearful weapons suddenly took to",
"travelling on the road between",
"Deal and Gravesend, catching the",
"yokels right and left to carry",
"heavy loads for them, I fancy",
"every farm and cottage",
"thereabouts would get empty very",
"soon. Only here the dwellings",
"were gone, too. Still I passed",
"through several abandoned",
"villages. There's something",
"pathetically childish in the",
"ruins of grass walls. Day after",
"day, with the stamp and shuffle",
"of sixty pair of bare feet behind",
"me, each pair under a 60-lb.",
"load. Camp, cook, sleep, strike",
"camp, march. Now and then a",
"carrier dead in harness, at rest",
"in the long grass near the path,",
"with an empty water-gourd and his",
"long staff lying by his side. A",
"great silence around and above.",
"Perhaps on some quiet night the",
"tremor of far-off drums, sinking,",
"swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a",
"sound weird, appealing,",
"suggestive, and wild—and perhaps",
"with as profound a meaning as the",
"sound of bells in a Christian",
"country. Once a white man in an",
"unbuttoned uniform, camping on",
"the path with an armed escort of",
"lank Zanzibaris, very hospitable",
"and festive—not to say drunk. Was",
"looking after the upkeep of the",
"road, he declared. Can't say I",
"saw any road or any upkeep,",
"unless the body of a middle-aged",
"negro, with a bullet-hole in the",
"forehead, upon which I absolutely",
"stumbled three miles farther on,",
"may be considered as a permanent",
"improvement. I had a white",
"companion, too, not a bad chap,",
"but rather too fleshy and with",
"the exasperating habit of",
"fainting on the hot hillsides,",
"miles away from the least bit of",
"shade and water. Annoying, you",
"know, to hold your own coat like",
"a parasol over a man's head while",
"he is coming to. I couldn't help",
"asking him once what he meant by",
"coming there at all. 'To make",
"money, of course. What do you",
"think?' he said, scornfully. Then",
"he got fever, and had to be",
"carried in a hammock slung under",
"a pole. As he weighed sixteen",
"stone I had no end of rows with",
"the carriers. They jibbed, ran",
"away, sneaked off with their",
"loads in the night—quite a",
"mutiny. So, one evening, I made a",
"speech in English with gestures,",
"not one of which was lost to the",
"sixty pairs of eyes before me,",
"and the next morning I started",
"the hammock off in front all",
"right. An hour afterwards I came",
"upon the whole concern wrecked in",
"a bush—man, hammock, groans,",
"blankets, horrors. The heavy pole",
"had skinned his poor nose. He was",
"very anxious for me to kill",
"somebody, but there wasn't the",
"shadow of a carrier near. I",
"remembered the old doctor—'It",
"would be interesting for science",
"to watch the mental changes of",
"individuals, on the spot.' I felt",
"I was becoming scientifically",
"interesting. However, all that is",
"to no purpose. On the fifteenth",
"day I came in sight of the big",
"river again, and hobbled into the",
"Central Station. It was on a back",
"water surrounded by scrub and",
"forest, with a pretty border of",
"smelly mud on one side, and on",
"the three others enclosed by a",
"crazy fence of rushes. A",
"neglected gap was all the gate it",
"had, and the first glance at the",
"place was enough to let you see",
"the flabby devil was running that",
"show. White men with long staves",
"in their hands appeared languidly",
"from amongst the buildings,",
"strolling up to take a look at",
"me, and then retired out of sight",
"somewhere. One of them, a stout,",
"excitable chap with black",
"moustaches, informed me with",
"great volubility and many",
"digressions, as soon as I told",
"him who I was, that my steamer",
"was at the bottom of the river. I",
"was thunderstruck. What, how,",
"why? Oh, it was 'all right.' The",
"'manager himself' was there. All",
"quite correct. 'Everybody had",
"behaved splendidly!",
"splendidly!'—'you must,' he said",
"in agitation, 'go and see the",
"general manager at once. He is",
"waiting!'",
"“I did not see the real",
"significance of that wreck at",
"once. I fancy I see it now, but I",
"am not sure—not at all. Certainly",
"the affair was too stupid—when I",
"think of it—to be altogether",
"natural. Still... But at the",
"moment it presented itself simply",
"as a confounded nuisance. The",
"steamer was sunk. They had",
"started two days before in a",
"sudden hurry up the river with",
"the manager on board, in charge",
"of some volunteer skipper, and",
"before they had been out three",
"hours they tore the bottom out of",
"her on stones, and she sank near",
"the south bank. I asked myself",
"what I was to do there, now my",
"boat was lost. As a matter of",
"fact, I had plenty to do in",
"fishing my command out of the",
"river. I had to set about it the",
"very next day. That, and the",
"repairs when I brought the pieces",
"to the station, took some months.",
"“My first interview with the",
"manager was curious. He did not",
"ask me to sit down after my",
"twenty-mile walk that morning. He",
"was commonplace in complexion, in",
"features, in manners, and in",
"voice. He was of middle size and",
"of ordinary build. His eyes, of",
"the usual blue, were perhaps",
"remarkably cold, and he certainly",
"could make his glance fall on one",
"as trenchant and heavy as an axe.",
"But even at these times the rest",
"of his person seemed to disclaim",
"the intention. Otherwise there",
"was only an indefinable, faint",
"expression of his lips, something",
"stealthy—a smile—not a smile—I",
"remember it, but I can't explain.",
"It was unconscious, this smile",
"was, though just after he had",
"said something it got intensified",
"for an instant. It came at the",
"end of his speeches like a seal",
"applied on the words to make the",
"meaning of the commonest phrase",
"appear absolutely inscrutable. He",
"was a common trader, from his",
"youth up employed in these",
"parts—nothing more. He was",
"obeyed, yet he inspired neither",
"love nor fear, nor even respect.",
"He inspired uneasiness. That was",
"it! Uneasiness. Not a definite",
"mistrust—just uneasiness—nothing",
"more. You have no idea how",
"effective such a... a... faculty",
"can be. He had no genius for",
"organizing, for initiative, or",
"for order even. That was evident",
"in such things as the deplorable",
"state of the station. He had no",
"learning, and no intelligence.",
"His position had come to him—why?",
"Perhaps because he was never",
"ill... He had served three terms",
"of three years out there...",
"Because triumphant health in the",
"general rout of constitutions is",
"a kind of power in itself. When",
"he went home on leave he rioted",
"on a large scale—pompously. Jack",
"ashore—with a difference—in",
"externals only. This one could",
"gather from his casual talk. He",
"originated nothing, he could keep",
"the routine going—that's all. But",
"he was great. He was great by",
"this little thing that it was",
"impossible to tell what could",
"control such a man. He never gave",
"that secret away. Perhaps there",
"was nothing within him. Such a",
"suspicion made one pause—for out",
"there there were no external",
"checks. Once when various",
"tropical diseases had laid low",
"almost every 'agent' in the",
"station, he was heard to say,",
"'Men who come out here should",
"have no entrails.' He sealed the",
"utterance with that smile of his,",
"as though it had been a door",
"opening into a darkness he had in",
"his keeping. You fancied you had",
"seen things—but the seal was on.",
"When annoyed at meal-times by the",
"constant quarrels of the white",
"men about precedence, he ordered",
"an immense round table to be",
"made, for which a special house",
"had to be built. This was the",
"station's mess-room. Where he sat",
"was the first place—the rest were",
"nowhere. One felt this to be his",
"unalterable conviction. He was",
"neither civil nor uncivil. He was",
"quiet. He allowed his 'boy'—an",
"overfed young negro from the",
"coast—to treat the white men,",
"under his very eyes, with",
"provoking insolence.",
"“He began to speak as soon as he",
"saw me. I had been very long on",
"the road. He could not wait. Had",
"to start without me. The up-river",
"stations had to be relieved.",
"There had been so many delays",
"already that he did not know who",
"was dead and who was alive, and",
"how they got on—and so on, and so",
"on. He paid no attention to my",
"explanations, and, playing with a",
"stick of sealing-wax, repeated",
"several times that the situation",
"was 'very grave, very grave.'",
"There were rumours that a very",
"important station was in",
"jeopardy, and its chief, Mr.",
"Kurtz, was ill. Hoped it was not",
"true. Mr. Kurtz was... I felt",
"weary and irritable. Hang Kurtz,",
"I thought. I interrupted him by",
"saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz",
"on the coast. 'Ah! So they talk",
"of him down there,' he murmured",
"to himself. Then he began again,",
"assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the",
"best agent he had, an exceptional",
"man, of the greatest importance",
"to the Company; therefore I could",
"understand his anxiety. He was,",
"he said, 'very, very uneasy.'",
"Certainly he fidgeted on his",
"chair a good deal, exclaimed,",
"'Ah, Mr. Kurtz!' broke the stick",
"of sealing-wax and seemed",
"dumfounded by the accident. Next",
"thing he wanted to know 'how long",
"it would take to'... I",
"interrupted him again. Being",
"hungry, you know, and kept on my",
"feet too. I was getting savage.",
"'How can I tell?' I said. 'I",
"haven't even seen the wreck",
"yet—some months, no doubt.' All",
"this talk seemed to me so futile.",
"'Some months,' he said. 'Well,",
"let us say three months before we",
"can make a start. Yes. That ought",
"to do the affair.' I flung out of",
"his hut (he lived all alone in a",
"clay hut with a sort of verandah)",
"muttering to myself my opinion of",
"him. He was a chattering idiot.",
"Afterwards I took it back when it",
"was borne in upon me startlingly",
"with what extreme nicety he had",
"estimated the time requisite for",
"the 'affair.'",
"“I went to work the next day,",
"turning, so to speak, my back on",
"that station. In that way only it",
"seemed to me I could keep my hold",
"on the redeeming facts of life.",
"Still, one must look about",
"sometimes; and then I saw this",
"station, these men strolling",
"aimlessly about in the sunshine",
"of the yard. I asked myself",
"sometimes what it all meant. They",
"wandered here and there with",
"their absurd long staves in their",
"hands, like a lot of faithless",
"pilgrims bewitched inside a",
"rotten fence. The word 'ivory'",
"rang in the air, was whispered,",
"was sighed. You would think they",
"were praying to it. A taint of",
"imbecile rapacity blew through it",
"all, like a whiff from some",
"corpse. By Jove! I've never seen",
"anything so unreal in my life.",
"And outside, the silent",
"wilderness surrounding this",
"cleared speck on the earth struck",
"me as something great and",
"invincible, like evil or truth,",
"waiting patiently for the passing",
"away of this fantastic invasion.",
"“Oh, these months! Well, never",
"mind. Various things happened.",
"One evening a grass shed full of",
"calico, cotton prints, beads, and",
"I don't know what else, burst",
"into a blaze so suddenly that you",
"would have thought the earth had",
"opened to let an avenging fire",
"consume all that trash. I was",
"smoking my pipe quietly by my",
"dismantled steamer, and saw them",
"all cutting capers in the light,",
"with their arms lifted high, when",
"the stout man with moustaches",
"came tearing down to the river, a",
"tin pail in his hand, assured me",
"that everybody was 'behaving",
"splendidly, splendidly,' dipped",
"about a quart of water and tore",
"back again. I noticed there was a",
"hole in the bottom of his pail.",
"“I strolled up. There was no",
"hurry. You see the thing had gone",
"off like a box of matches. It had",
"been hopeless from the very",
"first. The flame had leaped high,",
"driven everybody back, lighted up",
"everything—and collapsed. The",
"shed was already a heap of embers",
"glowing fiercely. A nigger was",
"being beaten near by. They said",
"he had caused the fire in some",
"way; be that as it may, he was",
"screeching most horribly. I saw",
"him, later, for several days,",
"sitting in a bit of shade looking",
"very sick and trying to recover",
"himself; afterwards he arose and",
"went out—and the wilderness",
"without a sound took him into its",
"bosom again. As I approached the",
"glow from the dark I found myself",
"at the back of two men, talking.",
"I heard the name of Kurtz",
"pronounced, then the words, 'take",
"advantage of this unfortunate",
"accident.' One of the men was the",
"manager. I wished him a good",
"evening. 'Did you ever see",
"anything like it—eh? it is",
"incredible,' he said, and walked",
"off. The other man remained. He",
"was a first-class agent, young,",
"gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with",
"a forked little beard and a",
"hooked nose. He was stand-offish",
"with the other agents, and they",
"on their side said he was the",
"manager's spy upon them. As to",
"me, I had hardly ever spoken to",
"him before. We got into talk, and",
"by and by we strolled away from",
"the hissing ruins. Then he asked",
"me to his room, which was in the",
"main building of the station. He",
"struck a match, and I perceived",
"that this young aristocrat had",
"not only a silver-mounted",
"dressing-case but also a whole",
"candle all to himself. Just at",
"that time the manager was the",
"only man supposed to have any",
"right to candles. Native mats",
"covered the clay walls; a",
"collection of spears, assegais,",
"shields, knives was hung up in",
"trophies. The business intrusted",
"to this fellow was the making of",
"bricks—so I had been informed;",
"but there wasn't a fragment of a",
"brick anywhere in the station,",
"and he had been there more than a",
"year—waiting. It seems he could",
"not make bricks without",
"something, I don't know",
"what—straw maybe. Anyway, it",
"could not be found there and as",
"it was not likely to be sent from",
"Europe, it did not appear clear",
"to me what he was waiting for. An",
"act of special creation perhaps.",
"However, they were all",
"waiting—all the sixteen or twenty",
"pilgrims of them—for something;",
"and upon my word it did not seem",
"an uncongenial occupation, from",
"the way they took it, though the",
"only thing that ever came to them",
"was disease—as far as I could",
"see. They beguiled the time by",
"back-biting and intriguing",
"against each other in a foolish",
"kind of way. There was an air of",
"plotting about that station, but",
"nothing came of it, of course. It",
"was as unreal as everything",
"else—as the philanthropic",
"pretence of the whole concern, as",
"their talk, as their government,",
"as their show of work. The only",
"real feeling was a desire to get",
"appointed to a trading-post where",
"ivory was to be had, so that they",
"could earn percentages. They",
"intrigued and slandered and hated",
"each other only on that",
"account—but as to effectually",
"lifting a little finger—oh, no.",
"By heavens! there is something",
"after all in the world allowing",
"one man to steal a horse while",
"another must not look at a",
"halter. Steal a horse straight",
"out. Very well. He has done it.",
"Perhaps he can ride. But there is",
"a way of looking at a halter that",
"would provoke the most charitable",
"of saints into a kick.",
"“I had no idea why he wanted to",
"be sociable, but as we chatted in",
"there it suddenly occurred to me",
"the fellow was trying to get at",
"something—in fact, pumping me. He",
"alluded constantly to Europe, to",
"the people I was supposed to know",
"there—putting leading questions",
"as to my acquaintances in the",
"sepulchral city, and so on. His",
"little eyes glittered like mica",
"discs—with curiosity—though he",
"tried to keep up a bit of",
"superciliousness. At first I was",
"astonished, but very soon I",
"became awfully curious to see",
"what he would find out from me. I",
"couldn't possibly imagine what I",
"had in me to make it worth his",
"while. It was very pretty to see",
"how he baffled himself, for in",
"truth my body was full only of",
"chills, and my head had nothing",
"in it but that wretched steamboat",
"business. It was evident he took",
"me for a perfectly shameless",
"prevaricator. At last he got",
"angry, and, to conceal a movement",
"of furious annoyance, he yawned.",
"I rose. Then I noticed a small",
"sketch in oils, on a panel,",
"representing a woman, draped and",
"blindfolded, carrying a lighted",
"torch. The background was",
"sombre—almost black. The movement",
"of the woman was stately, and the",
"effect of the torchlight on the",
"face was sinister.",
"“It arrested me, and he stood by",
"civilly, holding an empty",
"half-pint champagne bottle",
"(medical comforts) with the",
"candle stuck in it. To my",
"question he said Mr. Kurtz had",
"painted this—in this very station",
"more than a year ago—while",
"waiting for means to go to his",
"trading post. 'Tell me, pray,'",
"said I, 'who is this Mr. Kurtz?'",
"“'The chief of the Inner",
"Station,' he answered in a short",
"tone, looking away. 'Much",
"obliged,' I said, laughing. 'And",
"you are the brickmaker of the",
"Central Station. Every one knows",
"that.' He was silent for a while.",
"'He is a prodigy,' he said at",
"last. 'He is an emissary of pity",
"and science and progress, and",
"devil knows what else. We want,'",
"he began to declaim suddenly,",
"'for the guidance of the cause",
"intrusted to us by Europe, so to",
"speak, higher intelligence, wide",
"sympathies, a singleness of",
"purpose.' 'Who says that?' I",
"asked. 'Lots of them,' he",
"replied. 'Some even write that;",
"and so he comes here, a special",
"being, as you ought to know.'",
"'Why ought I to know?' I",
"interrupted, really surprised. He",
"paid no attention. 'Yes. Today he",
"is chief of the best station,",
"next year he will be",
"assistant-manager, two years more",
"and... but I dare-say you know",
"what he will be in two years'",
"time. You are of the new gang—the",
"gang of virtue. The same people",
"who sent him specially also",
"recommended you. Oh, don't say",
"no. I've my own eyes to trust.'",
"Light dawned upon me. My dear",
"aunt's influential acquaintances",
"were producing an unexpected",
"effect upon that young man. I",
"nearly burst into a laugh. 'Do",
"you read the Company's",
"confidential correspondence?' I",
"asked. He hadn't a word to say.",
"It was great fun. 'When Mr.",
"Kurtz,' I continued, severely,",
"'is General Manager, you won't",
"have the opportunity.'",
"“He blew the candle out suddenly,",
"and we went outside. The moon had",
"risen. Black figures strolled",
"about listlessly, pouring water",
"on the glow, whence proceeded a",
"sound of hissing; steam ascended",
"in the moonlight, the beaten",
"nigger groaned somewhere. 'What a",
"row the brute makes!' said the",
"indefatigable man with the",
"moustaches, appearing near us.",
"'Serve him right.",
"Transgression—punishment—bang!",
"Pitiless, pitiless. That's the",
"only way. This will prevent all",
"conflagrations for the future. I",
"was just telling the manager...'",
"He noticed my companion, and",
"became crestfallen all at once.",
"'Not in bed yet,' he said, with a",
"kind of servile heartiness; 'it's",
"so natural. Ha!",
"Danger—agitation.' He vanished. I",
"went on to the riverside, and the",
"other followed me. I heard a",
"scathing murmur at my ear, 'Heap",
"of muffs—go to.' The pilgrims",
"could be seen in knots",
"gesticulating, discussing.",
"Several had still their staves in",
"their hands. I verily believe",
"they took these sticks to bed",
"with them. Beyond the fence the",
"forest stood up spectrally in the",
"moonlight, and through that dim",
"stir, through the faint sounds of",
"that lamentable courtyard, the",
"silence of the land went home to",
"one's very heart—its mystery, its",
"greatness, the amazing reality of",
"its concealed life. The hurt",
"nigger moaned feebly somewhere",
"near by, and then fetched a deep",
"sigh that made me mend my pace",
"away from there. I felt a hand",
"introducing itself under my arm.",
"'My dear sir,' said the fellow,",
"'I don't want to be",
"misunderstood, and especially by",
"you, who will see Mr. Kurtz long",
"before I can have that pleasure.",
"I wouldn't like him to get a",
"false idea of my disposition....'",
"“I let him run on, this",
"papier-mache Mephistopheles, and",
"it seemed to me that if I tried I",
"could poke my forefinger through",
"him, and would find nothing",
"inside but a little loose dirt,",
"maybe. He, don't you see, had",
"been planning to be",
"assistant-manager by and by under",
"the present man, and I could see",
"that the coming of that Kurtz had",
"upset them both not a little. He",
"talked precipitately, and I did",
"not try to stop him. I had my",
"shoulders against the wreck of my",
"steamer, hauled up on the slope",
"like a carcass of some big river",
"animal. The smell of mud, of",
"primeval mud, by Jove! was in my",
"nostrils, the high stillness of",
"primeval forest was before my",
"eyes; there were shiny patches on",
"the black creek. The moon had",
"spread over everything a thin",
"layer of silver—over the rank",
"grass, over the mud, upon the",
"wall of matted vegetation",
"standing higher than the wall of",
"a temple, over the great river I",
"could see through a sombre gap",
"glittering, glittering, as it",
"flowed broadly by without a",
"murmur. All this was great,",
"expectant, mute, while the man",
"jabbered about himself. I",
"wondered whether the stillness on",
"the face of the immensity looking",
"at us two were meant as an appeal",
"or as a menace. What were we who",
"had strayed in here? Could we",
"handle that dumb thing, or would",
"it handle us? I felt how big, how",
"confoundedly big, was that thing",
"that couldn't talk, and perhaps",
"was deaf as well. What was in",
"there? I could see a little ivory",
"coming out from there, and I had",
"heard Mr. Kurtz was in there. I",
"had heard enough about it,",
"too—God knows! Yet somehow it",
"didn't bring any image with it—no",
"more than if I had been told an",
"angel or a fiend was in there. I",
"believed it in the same way one",
"of you might believe there are",
"inhabitants in the planet Mars. I",
"knew once a Scotch sailmaker who",
"was certain, dead sure, there",
"were people in Mars. If you asked",
"him for some idea how they looked",
"and behaved, he would get shy and",
"mutter something about 'walking",
"on all-fours.' If you as much as",
"smiled, he would—though a man of",
"sixty—offer to fight you. I would",
"not have gone so far as to fight",
"for Kurtz, but I went for him",
"near enough to a lie. You know I",
"hate, detest, and can't bear a",
"lie, not because I am straighter",
"than the rest of us, but simply",
"because it appalls me. There is a",
"taint of death, a flavour of",
"mortality in lies—which is",
"exactly what I hate and detest in",
"the world—what I want to forget.",
"It makes me miserable and sick,",
"like biting something rotten",
"would do. Temperament, I suppose.",
"Well, I went near enough to it by",
"letting the young fool there",
"believe anything he liked to",
"imagine as to my influence in",
"Europe. I became in an instant as",
"much of a pretence as the rest of",
"the bewitched pilgrims. This",
"simply because I had a notion it",
"somehow would be of help to that",
"Kurtz whom at the time I did not",
"see—you understand. He was just a",
"word for me. I did not see the",
"man in the name any more than you",
"do. Do you see him? Do you see",
"the story? Do you see anything?",
"It seems to me I am trying to",
"tell you a dream—making a vain",
"attempt, because no relation of a",
"dream can convey the",
"dream-sensation, that commingling",
"of absurdity, surprise, and",
"bewilderment in a tremor of",
"struggling revolt, that notion of",
"being captured by the incredible",
"which is of the very essence of",
"dreams....”",
"He was silent for a while.",
"“... No, it is impossible; it is",
"impossible to convey the",
"life-sensation of any given epoch",
"of one's existence—that which",
"makes its truth, its meaning—its",

"that were behind me. I did! And",
"there was nothing behind me!",
"There was nothing but that",
"wretched, old, mangled steamboat",
"I was leaning against, while he",
"talked fluently about 'the",
"necessity for every man to get",
"on.' 'And when one comes out",
"here, you conceive, it is not to",
"gaze at the moon.' Mr. Kurtz was",
"a 'universal genius,' but even a",
"genius would find it easier to",
"work with 'adequate",
"tools—intelligent men.' He did",
"not make bricks—why, there was a",
"physical impossibility in the",
"way—as I was well aware; and if",
"he did secretarial work for the",
"manager, it was because 'no",
"sensible man rejects wantonly the",

"I see it? I saw it. What more did",
"I want? What I really wanted was",
"rivets, by heaven! Rivets. To get",
"on with the work—to stop the",
"hole. Rivets I wanted. There were",
"cases of them down at the",
"coast—cases—piled up—burst—split!",
"You kicked a loose rivet at every",

"rolled into the grove of death.",
"You could fill your pockets with",
"rivets for the trouble of",

"would do, but nothing to fasten",
"them with. And every week the",
"messenger, a long negro,",
"letter-bag on shoulder and staff",

"coast. And several times a week a",
"coast caravan came in with trade",
"goods—ghastly glazed calico that",

"it, glass beads value about a",
"penny a quart, confounded spotted",
"cotton handkerchiefs. And no",
"rivets. Three carriers could have",

"was a certain quantity of",
"rivets—and rivets were what",
"really Mr. Kurtz wanted, if he",
"had only known it. Now letters",
"went to the coast every week....",
"'My dear sir,' he cried, 'I write",
"from dictation.' I demanded",
"rivets. There was a way—for an",
"intelligent man. He changed his",
"manner; became very cold, and",
"suddenly began to talk about a",
"hippopotamus; wondered whether",
"sleeping on board the steamer (I",
"stuck to my salvage night and",
"day) I wasn't disturbed. There",
"was an old hippo that had the bad",
"habit of getting out on the bank",
"and roaming at night over the",
"station grounds. The pilgrims",
"used to turn out in a body and",
"empty every rifle they could lay",
"hands on at him. Some even had",
"sat up o' nights for him. All",
"this energy was wasted, though.",
"'That animal has a charmed life,'",
"he said; 'but you can say this",
"only of brutes in this country.",
"No man—you apprehend me?—no man",
"here bears a charmed life.' He",
"stood there for a moment in the",
"moonlight with his delicate",
"hooked nose set a little askew,",
"and his mica eyes glittering",
"without a wink, then, with a curt",
"Good-night, he strode off. I",
"could see he was disturbed and",
"considerably puzzled, which made",
"me feel more hopeful than I had",
"been for days. It was a great",
"comfort to turn from that chap to",
"my influential friend, the",
"battered, twisted, ruined,",
"tin-pot steamboat. I clambered on",
"board. She rang under my feet",
"like an empty Huntley & Palmer",
"biscuit-tin kicked along a",
"gutter; she was nothing so solid",
"in make, and rather less pretty",
"in shape, but I had expended",
"enough hard work on her to make",
"me love her. No influential",
"friend would have served me",
"better. She had given me a chance",
"to come out a bit—to find out",
"what I could do. No, I don't like",
"work. I had rather laze about and",
"think of all the fine things that",
"can be done. I don't like work—no",
"man does—but I like what is in",
"the work—the chance to find",
"yourself. Your own reality—for",
"yourself, not for others—what no",
"other man can ever know. They can",
"only see the mere show, and never",
"can tell what it really means.",
"“I was not surprised to see",
"somebody sitting aft, on the",
"deck, with his legs dangling over",
"the mud. You see I rather chummed",
"with the few mechanics there were",
"in that station, whom the other",
"pilgrims naturally despised—on",
"account of their imperfect",
"manners, I suppose. This was the",
"foreman—a boiler-maker by trade—a",
"good worker. He was a lank, bony,",
"yellow-faced man, with big",
"intense eyes. His aspect was",
"worried, and his head was as bald",
"as the palm of my hand; but his",
"hair in falling seemed to have",
"stuck to his chin, and had",
"prospered in the new locality,",
"for his beard hung down to his",
"waist. He was a widower with six",
"young children (he had left them",
"in charge of a sister of his to",
"come out there), and the passion",
"of his life was pigeon-flying. He",
"was an enthusiast and a",
"connoisseur. He would rave about",
"pigeons. After work hours he used",
"sometimes to come over from his",
"hut for a talk about his children",
"and his pigeons; at work, when he",
"had to crawl in the mud under the",
"bottom of the steamboat, he would",
"tie up that beard of his in a",
"kind of white serviette he",
"brought for the purpose. It had",
"loops to go over his ears. In the",
"evening he could be seen squatted",
"on the bank rinsing that wrapper",
"in the creek with great care,",
"then spreading it solemnly on a",
"bush to dry.",
"“I slapped him on the back and",
"shouted, 'We shall have rivets!'",
"He scrambled to his feet",
"exclaiming, 'No! Rivets!' as",
"though he couldn't believe his",
"ears. Then in a low voice,",
"'You... eh?' I don't know why we",
"behaved like lunatics. I put my",
"finger to the side of my nose and",
"nodded mysteriously. 'Good for",
"you!' he cried, snapped his",
"fingers above his head, lifting",
"one foot. I tried a jig. We",
"capered on the iron deck. A",
"frightful clatter came out of",
"that hulk, and the virgin forest",
"on the other bank of the creek",
"sent it back in a thundering roll",
"upon the sleeping station. It",
"must have made some of the",
"pilgrims sit up in their hovels.",
"A dark figure obscured the",
"lighted doorway of the manager's",
"hut, vanished, then, a second or",
"so after, the doorway itself",
"vanished, too. We stopped, and",
"the silence driven away by the",
"stamping of our feet flowed back",
"again from the recesses of the",
"land. The great wall of",
"vegetation, an exuberant and",
"entangled mass of trunks,",
"branches, leaves, boughs,",
"festoons, motionless in the",
"moonlight, was like a rioting",
"invasion of soundless life, a",
"rolling wave of plants, piled up,",
"crested, ready to topple over the",
"creek, to sweep every little man",
"of us out of his little",
"existence. And it moved not. A",
"deadened burst of mighty splashes",
"and snorts reached us from afar,",
"as though an icthyosaurus had",
"been taking a bath of glitter in",
"the great river. 'After all,'",
"said the boiler-maker in a",
"reasonable tone, 'why shouldn't",
"we get the rivets?' Why not,",
"indeed! I did not know of any",
"reason why we shouldn't. 'They'll",
"come in three weeks,' I said",
"confidently.",
"“But they didn't. Instead of",
"rivets there came an invasion, an",
"infliction, a visitation. It came",
"in sections during the next three",
"weeks, each section headed by a",
"donkey carrying a white man in",
"new clothes and tan shoes, bowing",
"from that elevation right and",
"left to the impressed pilgrims. A",
"quarrelsome band of footsore",
"sulky niggers trod on the heels",
"of the donkey; a lot of tents,",
"camp-stools, tin boxes, white",
"cases, brown bales would be shot",
"down in the courtyard, and the",
"air of mystery would deepen a",
"little over the muddle of the",
"station. Five such instalments",
"came, with their absurd air of",
"disorderly flight with the loot",
"of innumerable outfit shops and",
"provision stores, that, one would",
"think, they were lugging, after a",
"raid, into the wilderness for",
"equitable division. It was an",
"inextricable mess of things",
"decent in themselves but that",
"human folly made look like the",
"spoils of thieving.",
"“This devoted band called itself",
"the Eldorado Exploring",
"Expedition, and I believe they",
"were sworn to secrecy. Their",
"talk, however, was the talk of",
"sordid buccaneers: it was",
"reckless without hardihood,",
"greedy without audacity, and",
"cruel without courage; there was",
"not an atom of foresight or of",
"serious intention in the whole",
"batch of them, and they did not",
"seem aware these things are",
"wanted for the work of the world.",
"To tear treasure out of the",
"bowels of the land was their",
"desire, with no more moral",
"purpose at the back of it than",
"there is in burglars breaking",
"into a safe. Who paid the",
"expenses of the noble enterprise",
"I don't know; but the uncle of",
"our manager was leader of that",
"lot.",
"“In exterior he resembled a",
"butcher in a poor neighbourhood,",
"and his eyes had a look of sleepy",
"cunning. He carried his fat",
"paunch with ostentation on his",
"short legs, and during the time",

"spoke to no one but his nephew.",
"You could see these two roaming",
"about all day long with their",
"heads close together in an",
"everlasting confab.",

"I had plenty of time for",
"meditation, and now and then I",
"would give some thought to Kurtz.",
"I wasn't very interested in him.",
"No. Still, I was curious to see",

"II",
"",
"“One evening as I was lying flat",
"on the deck of my steamboat, I",
"heard voices approaching—and",
"there were the nephew and the",
"uncle strolling along the bank. I",
"laid my head on my arm again, and",
"had nearly lost myself in a doze,",
"when somebody said in my ear, as",
"it were: 'I am as harmless as a",
"little child, but I don't like to",
"be dictated to. Am I the",
"manager—or am I not? I was",
"ordered to send him there. It's",
"incredible.' ... I became aware",
"that the two were standing on the",
"shore alongside the forepart of",
"the steamboat, just below my",
"head. I did not move; it did not",
"occur to me to move: I was",
"sleepy. 'It is unpleasant,'",
"grunted the uncle. 'He has asked",
"the Administration to be sent",
"there,' said the other, 'with the",
"idea of showing what he could do;",
"and I was instructed accordingly.",
"Look at the influence that man",
"must have. Is it not frightful?'",
"They both agreed it was",
"frightful, then made several",
"bizarre remarks: 'Make rain and",
"fine weather—one man—the",
"Council—by the nose'—bits of",
"absurd sentences that got the",
"better of my drowsiness, so that",
"I had pretty near the whole of my",
"wits about me when the uncle",
"said, 'The climate may do away",
"with this difficulty for you. Is",
"he alone there?' 'Yes,' answered",
"the manager; 'he sent his",
"assistant down the river with a",
"note to me in these terms: “Clear",
"this poor devil out of the",
"country, and don't bother sending",
"more of that sort. I had rather",
"be alone than have the kind of",
"men you can dispose of with me.”",
"It was more than a year ago. Can",
"you imagine such impudence!'",
"'Anything since then?' asked the",
"other hoarsely. 'Ivory,' jerked",
"the nephew; 'lots of it—prime",
"sort—lots—most annoying, from",
"him.' 'And with that?' questioned",
"the heavy rumble. 'Invoice,' was",
"the reply fired out, so to speak.",
"Then silence. They had been",
"talking about Kurtz.",
"“I was broad awake by this time,",
"but, lying perfectly at ease,",
"remained still, having no",
"inducement to change my position.",
"'How did that ivory come all this",
"way?' growled the elder man, who",
"seemed very vexed. The other",
"explained that it had come with a",
"fleet of canoes in charge of an",
"English half-caste clerk Kurtz",
"had with him; that Kurtz had",
"apparently intended to return",
"himself, the station being by",
"that time bare of goods and",
"stores, but after coming three",
"hundred miles, had suddenly",
"decided to go back, which he",
"started to do alone in a small",
"dugout with four paddlers,",
"leaving the half-caste to",
"continue down the river with the",
"ivory. The two fellows there",
"seemed astounded at anybody",
"attempting such a thing. They",
"were at a loss for an adequate",
"motive. As to me, I seemed to see",
"Kurtz for the first time. It was",
"a distinct glimpse: the dugout,",
"four paddling savages, and the",
"lone white man turning his back",
"suddenly on the headquarters, on",
"relief, on thoughts of",
"home—perhaps; setting his face",
"towards the depths of the",
"wilderness, towards his empty and",
"desolate station. I did not know",
"the motive. Perhaps he was just",
"simply a fine fellow who stuck to",
"his work for its own sake. His",
"name, you understand, had not",
"been pronounced once. He was",
"'that man.' The half-caste, who,",
"as far as I could see, had",
"conducted a difficult trip with",
"great prudence and pluck, was",
"invariably alluded to as 'that",
"scoundrel.' The 'scoundrel' had",
"reported that the 'man' had been",
"very ill—had recovered",
"imperfectly.... The two below me",
"moved away then a few paces, and",
"strolled back and forth at some",
"little distance. I heard:",
"'Military post—doctor—two hundred",
"miles—quite alone now—unavoidable",
"delays—nine months—no",
"news—strange rumours.' They",
"approached again, just as the",
"manager was saying, 'No one, as",
"far as I know, unless a species",
"of wandering trader—a",
"pestilential fellow, snapping",
"ivory from the natives.' Who was",
"it they were talking about now? I",
"gathered in snatches that this",
"was some man supposed to be in",
"Kurtz's district, and of whom the",
"manager did not approve. 'We will",
"not be free from unfair",
"competition till one of these",
"fellows is hanged for an",
"example,' he said. 'Certainly,'",
"grunted the other; 'get him",
"hanged! Why not?",
"Anything—anything can be done in",
"this country. That's what I say;",
"nobody here, you understand,",
"here, can endanger your position.",
"And why? You stand the",
"climate—you outlast them all. The",
"danger is in Europe; but there",
"before I left I took care to—'",
"They moved off and whispered,",
"then their voices rose again.",
"'The extraordinary series of",
"delays is not my fault. I did my",
"best.' The fat man sighed. 'Very",
"sad.' 'And the pestiferous",
"absurdity of his talk,' continued",
"the other; 'he bothered me enough",
"when he was here. “Each station",
"should be like a beacon on the",
"road towards better things, a",
"centre for trade of course, but",
"also for humanizing, improving,",
"instructing.” Conceive you—that",
"ass! And he wants to be manager!",
"No, it's—' Here he got choked by",
"excessive indignation, and I",
"lifted my head the least bit. I",
"was surprised to see how near",
"they were—right under me. I could",
"have spat upon their hats. They",
"were looking on the ground,",
"absorbed in thought. The manager",
"was switching his leg with a",
"slender twig: his sagacious",
"relative lifted his head. 'You",
"have been well since you came out",
"this time?' he asked. The other",
"gave a start. 'Who? I? Oh! Like a",
"charm—like a charm. But the",
"rest—oh, my goodness! All sick.",
"They die so quick, too, that I",
"haven't the time to send them out",
"of the country—it's incredible!'",
"'Hm'm. Just so,' grunted the",
"uncle. 'Ah! my boy, trust to",
"this—I say, trust to this.' I saw",
"him extend his short flipper of",
"an arm for a gesture that took in",
"the forest, the creek, the mud,",
"the river—seemed to beckon with a",
"dishonouring flourish before the",
"sunlit face of the land a",
"treacherous appeal to the lurking",
"death, to the hidden evil, to the",
"profound darkness of its heart.",
"It was so startling that I leaped",
"to my feet and looked back at the",
"edge of the forest, as though I",
"had expected an answer of some",
"sort to that black display of",
"confidence. You know the foolish",
"notions that come to one",
"sometimes. The high stillness",
"confronted these two figures with",
"its ominous patience, waiting for",
"the passing away of a fantastic",
"invasion.",
"“They swore aloud together—out of",
"sheer fright, I believe—then",
"pretending not to know anything",
"of my existence, turned back to",
"the station. The sun was low; and",
"leaning forward side by side,",
"they seemed to be tugging",
"painfully uphill their two",
"ridiculous shadows of unequal",
"length, that trailed behind them",
"slowly over the tall grass",
"without bending a single blade.",
"“In a few days the Eldorado",
"Expedition went into the patient",
"wilderness, that closed upon it",
"as the sea closes over a diver.",
"Long afterwards the news came",
"that all the donkeys were dead. I",
"know nothing as to the fate of",
"the less valuable animals. They,",
"no doubt, like the rest of us,",
"found what they deserved. I did",
"not inquire. I was then rather",
"excited at the prospect of",
"meeting Kurtz very soon. When I",
"say very soon I mean it",
"comparatively. It was just two",
"months from the day we left the",
"creek when we came to the bank",
"below Kurtz's station.",
"“Going up that river was like",
"traveling back to the earliest",
"beginnings of the world, when",
"vegetation rioted on the earth",
"and the big trees were kings. An",
"empty stream, a great silence, an",
"impenetrable forest. The air was",
"warm, thick, heavy, sluggish.",
"There was no joy in the",
"brilliance of sunshine. The long",
"stretches of the waterway ran on,",
"deserted, into the gloom of",
"overshadowed distances. On",
"silvery sand-banks hippos and",
"alligators sunned themselves side",
"by side. The broadening waters",
"flowed through a mob of wooded",
"islands; you lost your way on",
"that river as you would in a",
"desert, and butted all day long",
"against shoals, trying to find",
"the channel, till you thought",
"yourself bewitched and cut off",
"for ever from everything you had",
"known once—somewhere—far away—in",
"another existence perhaps. There",
"were moments when one's past came",
"back to one, as it will sometimes",
"when you have not a moment to",
"spare for yourself; but it came",
"in the shape of an unrestful and",
"noisy dream, remembered with",
"wonder amongst the overwhelming",
"realities of this strange world",
"of plants, and water, and",
"silence. And this stillness of",
"life did not in the least",
"resemble a peace. It was the",
"stillness of an implacable force",
"brooding over an inscrutable",
"intention. It looked at you with",
"a vengeful aspect. I got used to",
"it afterwards; I did not see it",
"any more; I had no time. I had to",
"keep guessing at the channel; I",
"had to discern, mostly by",
"inspiration, the signs of hidden",
"banks; I watched for sunken",
"stones; I was learning to clap my",
"teeth smartly before my heart",
"flew out, when I shaved by a",
"fluke some infernal sly old snag",
"that would have ripped the life",
"out of the tin-pot steamboat and",
"drowned all the pilgrims; I had",
"to keep a lookout for the signs",
"of dead wood we could cut up in",
"the night for next day's",
"steaming. When you have to attend",
"to things of that sort, to the",
"mere incidents of the surface,",
"the reality—the reality, I tell",
"you—fades. The inner truth is",
"hidden—luckily, luckily. But I",
"felt it all the same; I felt",
"often its mysterious stillness",
"watching me at my monkey tricks,",
"just as it watches you fellows",
"performing on your respective",
"tight-ropes for—what is it?",
"half-a-crown a tumble—”",
"“Try to be civil, Marlow,”",
"growled a voice, and I knew there",
"was at least one listener awake",
"besides myself.",
"“I beg your pardon. I forgot the",
"heartache which makes up the rest",
"of the price. And indeed what",
"does the price matter, if the",
"trick be well done? You do your",
"tricks very well. And I didn't do",
"badly either, since I managed not",
"to sink that steamboat on my",
"first trip. It's a wonder to me",
"yet. Imagine a blindfolded man",
"set to drive a van over a bad",
"road. I sweated and shivered over",
"that business considerably, I can",
"tell you. After all, for a",
"seaman, to scrape the bottom of",
"the thing that's supposed to",
"float all the time under his care",
"is the unpardonable sin. No one",
"may know of it, but you never",
"forget the thump—eh? A blow on",
"the very heart. You remember it,",
"you dream of it, you wake up at",
"night and think of it—years",
"after—and go hot and cold all",
"over. I don't pretend to say that",
"steamboat floated all the time.",
"More than once she had to wade",
"for a bit, with twenty cannibals",
"splashing around and pushing. We",
"had enlisted some of these chaps",
"on the way for a crew. Fine",
"fellows—cannibals—in their place.",
"They were men one could work",
"with, and I am grateful to them.",
"And, after all, they did not eat",
"each other before my face: they",
"had brought along a provision of",
"hippo-meat which went rotten, and",
"made the mystery of the",
"wilderness stink in my nostrils.",
"Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had",
"the manager on board and three or",
"four pilgrims with their",
"staves—all complete. Sometimes we",
"came upon a station close by the",
"bank, clinging to the skirts of",
"the unknown, and the white men",
"rushing out of a tumble-down",
"hovel, with great gestures of joy",
"and surprise and welcome, seemed",
"very strange—had the appearance",
"of being held there captive by a",
"spell. The word ivory would ring",
"in the air for a while—and on we",
"went again into the silence,",
"along empty reaches, round the",
"still bends, between the high",
"walls of our winding way,",
"reverberating in hollow claps the",
"ponderous beat of the",
"stern-wheel. Trees, trees,",
"millions of trees, massive,",
"immense, running up high; and at",
"their foot, hugging the bank",
"against the stream, crept the",
"little begrimed steamboat, like a",
"sluggish beetle crawling on the",
"floor of a lofty portico. It made",
"you feel very small, very lost,",
"and yet it was not altogether",
"depressing, that feeling. After",
"all, if you were small, the grimy",
"beetle crawled on—which was just",
"what you wanted it to do. Where",
"the pilgrims imagined it crawled",
"to I don't know. To some place",
"where they expected to get",
"something. I bet! For me it",
"crawled towards",
"Kurtz—exclusively; but when the",
"steam-pipes started leaking we",
"crawled very slow. The reaches",
"opened before us and closed",
"behind, as if the forest had",
"stepped leisurely across the",
"water to bar the way for our",
"return. We penetrated deeper and",
"deeper into the heart of",
"darkness. It was very quiet",
"there. At night sometimes the",
"roll of drums behind the curtain",
"of trees would run up the river",
"and remain sustained faintly, as",
"if hovering in the air high over",
"our heads, till the first break",
"of day. Whether it meant war,",
"peace, or prayer we could not",
"tell. The dawns were heralded by",
"the descent of a chill stillness;",
"the wood-cutters slept, their",
"fires burned low; the snapping of",
"a twig would make you start. We",
"were wanderers on a prehistoric",
"earth, on an earth that wore the",
"aspect of an unknown planet. We",
"could have fancied ourselves the",
"first of men taking possession of",
"an accursed inheritance, to be",
"subdued at the cost of profound",
"anguish and of excessive toil.",
"But suddenly, as we struggled",
"round a bend, there would be a",
"glimpse of rush walls, of peaked",
"grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a",
"whirl of black limbs, a mass of",
"hands clapping of feet stamping,",
"of bodies swaying, of eyes",
"rolling, under the droop of heavy",
"and motionless foliage. The",
"steamer toiled along slowly on",
"the edge of a black and",
"incomprehensible frenzy. The",
"prehistoric man was cursing us,",
"praying to us, welcoming us—who",
"could tell? We were cut off from",
"the comprehension of our",
"surroundings; we glided past like",
"phantoms, wondering and secretly",
"appalled, as sane men would be",
"before an enthusiastic outbreak",
"in a madhouse. We could not",
"understand because we were too",
"far and could not remember",
"because we were travelling in the",
"night of first ages, of those",
"ages that are gone, leaving",
"hardly a sign—and no memories.",
"“The earth seemed unearthly. We",
"are accustomed to look upon the",
"shackled form of a conquered",
"monster, but there—there you",
"could look at a thing monstrous",
"and free. It was unearthly, and",
"the men were—No, they were not",
"inhuman. Well, you know, that was",
"the worst of it—this suspicion of",
"their not being inhuman. It would",
"come slowly to one. They howled",
"and leaped, and spun, and made",
"horrid faces; but what thrilled",
"you was just the thought of their",
"humanity—like yours—the thought",
"of your remote kinship with this",
"wild and passionate uproar. Ugly.",
"Yes, it was ugly enough; but if",
"you were man enough you would",
"admit to yourself that there was",
"in you just the faintest trace of",
"a response to the terrible",
"frankness of that noise, a dim",
"suspicion of there being a",
"meaning in it which you—you so",
"remote from the night of first",
"ages—could comprehend. And why",
"not? The mind of man is capable",
"of anything—because everything is",
"in it, all the past as well as",
"all the future. What was there",
"after all? Joy, fear, sorrow,",
"devotion, valour, rage—who can",
"tell?—but truth—truth stripped of",
"its cloak of time. Let the fool",
"gape and shudder—the man knows,",
"and can look on without a wink.",
"But he must at least be as much",
"of a man as these on the shore.",
"He must meet that truth with his",
"own true stuff—with his own",
"inborn strength. Principles won't",
"do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty",
"rags—rags that would fly off at",
"the first good shake. No; you",
"want a deliberate belief. An",
"appeal to me in this fiendish",
"row—is there? Very well; I hear;",
"I admit, but I have a voice, too,",
"and for good or evil mine is the",
"speech that cannot be silenced.",
"Of course, a fool, what with",
"sheer fright and fine sentiments,",
"is always safe. Who's that",
"grunting? You wonder I didn't go",
"ashore for a howl and a dance?",
"Well, no—I didn't. Fine",
"sentiments, you say? Fine",
"sentiments, be hanged! I had no",
"time. I had to mess about with",
"white-lead and strips of woolen",
"blanket helping to put bandages",
"on those leaky steam-pipes—I tell",
"you. I had to watch the steering,",
"and circumvent those snags, and",
"get the tin-pot along by hook or",
"by crook. There was surface-truth",
"enough in these things to save a",
"wiser man. And between whiles I",
"had to look after the savage who",
"was fireman. He was an improved",
"specimen; he could fire up a",
"vertical boiler. He was there",
"below me, and, upon my word, to",
"look at him was as edifying as",
"seeing a dog in a parody of",
"breeches and a feather hat,",
"walking on his hind-legs. A few",
"months of training had done for",
"that really fine chap. He",
"squinted at the steam-gauge and",
"at the water-gauge with an",
"evident effort of intrepidity—and",
"he had filed teeth, too, the poor",
"devil, and the wool of his pate",
"shaved into queer patterns, and",
"three ornamental scars on each of",
"his cheeks. He ought to have been",
"clapping his hands and stamping",
"his feet on the bank, instead of",
"which he was hard at work, a",
"thrall to strange witchcraft,",
"full of improving knowledge. He",
"was useful because he had been",
"instructed; and what he knew was",
"this—that should the water in",
"that transparent thing disappear,",
"the evil spirit inside the boiler",
"would get angry through the",
"greatness of his thirst, and take",
"a terrible vengeance. So he",
"sweated and fired up and watched",
"the glass fearfully (with an",
"impromptu charm, made of rags,",
"tied to his arm, and a piece of",
"polished bone, as big as a watch,",
"stuck flatways through his lower",
"lip), while the wooded banks",
"slipped past us slowly, the short",
"noise was left behind, the",
"interminable miles of silence—and",
"we crept on, towards Kurtz. But",
"the snags were thick, the water",
"was treacherous and shallow, the",
"boiler seemed indeed to have a",
"sulky devil in it, and thus",
"neither that fireman nor I had",
"any time to peer into our creepy",
"thoughts.",
"“Some fifty miles below the Inner",
"Station we came upon a hut of",
"reeds, an inclined and melancholy",
"pole, with the unrecognizable",
"tatters of what had been a flag",
"of some sort flying from it, and",
"a neatly stacked wood-pile. This",
"was unexpected. We came to the",
"bank, and on the stack of",
"firewood found a flat piece of",
"board with some faded",
"pencil-writing on it. When",
"deciphered it said: 'Wood for",
"you. Hurry up. Approach",
"cautiously.' There was a",
"signature, but it was",
"illegible—not Kurtz—a much longer",
"word. 'Hurry up.' Where? Up the",
"river? 'Approach cautiously.' We",
"had not done so. But the warning",
"could not have been meant for the",
"place where it could be only",
"found after approach. Something",
"was wrong above. But what—and how",
"much? That was the question. We",
"commented adversely upon the",
"imbecility of that telegraphic",
"style. The bush around said",
"nothing, and would not let us",
"look very far, either. A torn",
"curtain of red twill hung in the",
"doorway of the hut, and flapped",
"sadly in our faces. The dwelling",
"was dismantled; but we could see",
"a white man had lived there not",
"very long ago. There remained a",
"rude table—a plank on two posts;",
"a heap of rubbish reposed in a",
"dark corner, and by the door I",
"picked up a book. It had lost its",
"covers, and the pages had been",
"thumbed into a state of extremely",
"dirty softness; but the back had",
"been lovingly stitched afresh",
"with white cotton thread, which",
"looked clean yet. It was an",
"extraordinary find. Its title",
"was, An Inquiry into some Points",
"of Seamanship, by a man Towser,",
"Towson—some such name—Master in",
"his Majesty's Navy. The matter",
"looked dreary reading enough,",
"with illustrative diagrams and",
"repulsive tables of figures, and",
"the copy was sixty years old. I",
"handled this amazing antiquity",
"with the greatest possible",
"tenderness, lest it should",
"dissolve in my hands. Within,",
"Towson or Towser was inquiring",
"earnestly into the breaking",
"strain of ships' chains and",
"tackle, and other such matters.",
"Not a very enthralling book; but",
"at the first glance you could see",
"there a singleness of intention,",
"an honest concern for the right",
"way of going to work, which made",
"these humble pages, thought out",
"so many years ago, luminous with",
"another than a professional",
"light. The simple old sailor,",
"with his talk of chains and",
"purchases, made me forget the",
"jungle and the pilgrims in a",
"delicious sensation of having",
"come upon something unmistakably",
"real. Such a book being there was",
"wonderful enough; but still more",
"astounding were the notes",
"pencilled in the margin, and",
"plainly referring to the text. I",
"couldn't believe my eyes! They",
"were in cipher! Yes, it looked",
"like cipher. Fancy a man lugging",
"with him a book of that",
"description into this nowhere and",
"studying it—and making notes—in",
"cipher at that! It was an",
"extravagant mystery.",
"“I had been dimly aware for some",
"time of a worrying noise, and",
"when I lifted my eyes I saw the",
"wood-pile was gone, and the",
"manager, aided by all the",
"pilgrims, was shouting at me from",
"the riverside. I slipped the book",
"into my pocket. I assure you to",
"leave off reading was like",
"tearing myself away from the",
"shelter of an old and solid",
"friendship.",
"“I started the lame engine ahead.",
"'It must be this miserable",
"trader—this intruder,' exclaimed",
"the manager, looking back",
"malevolently at the place we had",
"left. 'He must be English,' I",
"said. 'It will not save him from",
"getting into trouble if he is not",
"careful,' muttered the manager",
"darkly. I observed with assumed",
"innocence that no man was safe",
"from trouble in this world.",
"“The current was more rapid now,",
"the steamer seemed at her last",
"gasp, the stern-wheel flopped",
"languidly, and I caught myself",
"listening on tiptoe for the next",
"beat of the boat, for in sober",
"truth I expected the wretched",
"thing to give up every moment. It",
"was like watching the last",
"flickers of a life. But still we",
"crawled. Sometimes I would pick",
"out a tree a little way ahead to",
"measure our progress towards",
"Kurtz by, but I lost it",
"invariably before we got abreast.",
"To keep the eyes so long on one",
"thing was too much for human",
"patience. The manager displayed a",
"beautiful resignation. I fretted",
"and fumed and took to arguing",
"with myself whether or no I would",
"talk openly with Kurtz; but",
"before I could come to any",
"conclusion it occurred to me that",
"my speech or my silence, indeed",
"any action of mine, would be a",
"mere futility. What did it matter",
"what any one knew or ignored?",
"What did it matter who was",
"manager? One gets sometimes such",
"a flash of insight. The",
"essentials of this affair lay",
"deep under the surface, beyond my",
"reach, and beyond my power of",
"meddling.",
"“Towards the evening of the",
"second day we judged ourselves",
"about eight miles from Kurtz's",
"station. I wanted to push on; but",
"the manager looked grave, and",
"told me the navigation up there",
"was so dangerous that it would be",
"advisable, the sun being very low",
"already, to wait where we were",
"till next morning. Moreover, he",
"pointed out that if the warning",
"to approach cautiously were to be",
"followed, we must approach in",
"daylight—not at dusk or in the",
"dark. This was sensible enough.",
"Eight miles meant nearly three",
"hours' steaming for us, and I",
"could also see suspicious ripples",
"at the upper end of the reach.",
"Nevertheless, I was annoyed",
"beyond expression at the delay,",
"and most unreasonably, too, since",
"one night more could not matter",
"much after so many months. As we",
"had plenty of wood, and caution",
"was the word, I brought up in the",
"middle of the stream. The reach",
"was narrow, straight, with high",
"sides like a railway cutting. The",
"dusk came gliding into it long",
"before the sun had set. The",
"current ran smooth and swift, but",
"a dumb immobility sat on the",
"banks. The living trees, lashed",
"together by the creepers and",
"every living bush of the",
"undergrowth, might have been",
"changed into stone, even to the",
"slenderest twig, to the lightest",
"leaf. It was not sleep—it seemed",
"unnatural, like a state of",
"trance. Not the faintest sound of",
"any kind could be heard. You",
"looked on amazed, and began to",
"suspect yourself of being",
"deaf—then the night came",
"suddenly, and struck you blind as",
"well. About three in the morning",
"some large fish leaped, and the",
"loud splash made me jump as",
"though a gun had been fired. When",
"the sun rose there was a white",
"fog, very warm and clammy, and",
"more blinding than the night. It",
"did not shift or drive; it was",
"just there, standing all round",
"you like something solid. At",
"eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted",
"as a shutter lifts. We had a",
"glimpse of the towering multitude",
"of trees, of the immense matted",
"jungle, with the blazing little",
"ball of the sun hanging over",
"it—all perfectly still—and then",
"the white shutter came down",
"again, smoothly, as if sliding in",
"greased grooves. I ordered the",
"chain, which we had begun to",
"heave in, to be paid out again.",
"Before it stopped running with a",
"muffled rattle, a cry, a very",
"loud cry, as of infinite",
"desolation, soared slowly in the",
"opaque air. It ceased. A",
"complaining clamour, modulated in",
"savage discords, filled our ears.",
"The sheer unexpectedness of it",
"made my hair stir under my cap. I",
"don't know how it struck the",
"others: to me it seemed as though",
"the mist itself had screamed, so",
"suddenly, and apparently from all",
"sides at once, did this",
"tumultuous and mournful uproar",
"arise. It culminated in a hurried",
"outbreak of almost intolerably",
"excessive shrieking, which",
"stopped short, leaving us",
"stiffened in a variety of silly",
"attitudes, and obstinately",
"listening to the nearly as",
"appalling and excessive silence.",
"'Good God! What is the meaning—'",
"stammered at my elbow one of the",
"pilgrims—a little fat man, with",
"sandy hair and red whiskers, who",
"wore sidespring boots, and pink",
"pyjamas tucked into his socks.",
"Two others remained open-mouthed",
"a while minute, then dashed into",
"the little cabin, to rush out",
"incontinently and stand darting",
"scared glances, with Winchesters",
"at 'ready' in their hands. What",
"we could see was just the steamer",
"we were on, her outlines blurred",
"as though she had been on the",
"point of dissolving, and a misty",
"strip of water, perhaps two feet",
"broad, around her—and that was",
"all. The rest of the world was",
"nowhere, as far as our eyes and",
"ears were concerned. Just",
"nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept",
"off without leaving a whisper or",
"a shadow behind.",
"“I went forward, and ordered the",
"chain to be hauled in short, so",
"as to be ready to trip the anchor",
"and move the steamboat at once if",
"necessary. 'Will they attack?'",
"whispered an awed voice. 'We will",
"be all butchered in this fog,'",
"murmured another. The faces",
"twitched with the strain, the",
"hands trembled slightly, the eyes",
"forgot to wink. It was very",
"curious to see the contrast of",
"expressions of the white men and",
"of the black fellows of our crew,",
"who were as much strangers to",
"that part of the river as we,",
"though their homes were only",
"eight hundred miles away. The",
"whites, of course greatly",
"discomposed, had besides a",
"curious look of being painfully",
"shocked by such an outrageous",
"row. The others had an alert,",
"naturally interested expression;",
"but their faces were essentially",
"quiet, even those of the one or",
"two who grinned as they hauled at",
"the chain. Several exchanged",
"short, grunting phrases, which",
"seemed to settle the matter to",
"their satisfaction. Their",
"headman, a young, broad-chested",
"black, severely draped in",
"dark-blue fringed cloths, with",
"fierce nostrils and his hair all",
"done up artfully in oily",
"ringlets, stood near me. 'Aha!' I",
"said, just for good fellowship's",
"sake. 'Catch 'im,' he snapped,",
"with a bloodshot widening of his",
"eyes and a flash of sharp",
"teeth—'catch 'im. Give 'im to",
"us.' 'To you, eh?' I asked; 'what",
"would you do with them?' 'Eat",
"'im!' he said curtly, and,",
"leaning his elbow on the rail,",
"looked out into the fog in a",
"dignified and profoundly pensive",
"attitude. I would no doubt have",
"been properly horrified, had it",
"not occurred to me that he and",
"his chaps must be very hungry:",
"that they must have been growing",
"increasingly hungry for at least",
"this month past. They had been",
"engaged for six months (I don't",
"think a single one of them had",
"any clear idea of time, as we at",
"the end of countless ages have.",
"They still belonged to the",
"beginnings of time—had no",
"inherited experience to teach",
"them as it were), and of course,",
"as long as there was a piece of",
"paper written over in accordance",
"with some farcical law or other",
"made down the river, it didn't",
"enter anybody's head to trouble",
"how they would live. Certainly",
"they had brought with them some",
"rotten hippo-meat, which couldn't",
"have lasted very long, anyway,",
"even if the pilgrims hadn't, in",
"the midst of a shocking",
"hullabaloo, thrown a considerable",
"quantity of it overboard. It",
"looked like a high-handed",
"proceeding; but it was really a",
"case of legitimate self-defence.",
"You can't breathe dead hippo",
"waking, sleeping, and eating, and",
"at the same time keep your",
"precarious grip on existence.",
"Besides that, they had given them",
"every week three pieces of brass",
"wire, each about nine inches",
"long; and the theory was they",
"were to buy their provisions with",
"that currency in riverside",
"villages. You can see how that",
"worked. There were either no",
"villages, or the people were",
"hostile, or the director, who",
"like the rest of us fed out of",
"tins, with an occasional old",
"he-goat thrown in, didn't want to",
"stop the steamer for some more or",
"less recondite reason. So, unless",
"they swallowed the wire itself,",
"or made loops of it to snare the",
"fishes with, I don't see what",
"good their extravagant salary",
"could be to them. I must say it",
"was paid with a regularity worthy",
"of a large and honourable trading",
"company. For the rest, the only",
"thing to eat—though it didn't",
"look eatable in the least—I saw",
"in their possession was a few",
"lumps of some stuff like",
"half-cooked dough, of a dirty",
"lavender colour, they kept",
"wrapped in leaves, and now and",
"then swallowed a piece of, but so",
"small that it seemed done more",
"for the looks of the thing than",
"for any serious purpose of",
"sustenance. Why in the name of",
"all the gnawing devils of hunger",
"they didn't go for us—they were",
"thirty to five—and have a good",
"tuck-in for once, amazes me now",
"when I think of it. They were big",
"powerful men, with not much",
"capacity to weigh the",
"consequences, with courage, with",
"strength, even yet, though their",
"skins were no longer glossy and",
"their muscles no longer hard. And",
"I saw that something restraining,",
"one of those human secrets that",
"baffle probability, had come into",
"play there. I looked at them with",
"a swift quickening of",
"interest—not because it occurred",
"to me I might be eaten by them",
"before very long, though I own to",
"you that just then I perceived—in",
"a new light, as it were—how",
"unwholesome the pilgrims looked,",
"and I hoped, yes, I positively",
"hoped, that my aspect was not",
"so—what shall I",
"say?—so—unappetizing: a touch of",
"fantastic vanity which fitted",
"well with the dream-sensation",
"that pervaded all my days at that",
"time. Perhaps I had a little",
"fever, too. One can't live with",
"one's finger everlastingly on",
"one's pulse. I had often 'a",
"little fever,' or a little touch",
"of other things—the playful",
"paw-strokes of the wilderness,",
"the preliminary trifling before",
"the more serious onslaught which",
"came in due course. Yes; I looked",
"at them as you would on any human",
"being, with a curiosity of their",
"impulses, motives, capacities,",
"weaknesses, when brought to the",
"test of an inexorable physical",
"necessity. Restraint! What",
"possible restraint? Was it",
"superstition, disgust, patience,",
"fear—or some kind of primitive",
"honour? No fear can stand up to",
"hunger, no patience can wear it",
"out, disgust simply does not",
"exist where hunger is; and as to",
"superstition, beliefs, and what",
"you may call principles, they are",
"less than chaff in a breeze.",
"Don't you know the devilry of",
"lingering starvation, its",
"exasperating torment, its black",
"thoughts, its sombre and brooding",
"ferocity? Well, I do. It takes a",
"man all his inborn strength to",
"fight hunger properly. It's",
"really easier to face",
"bereavement, dishonour, and the",
"perdition of one's soul—than this",
"kind of prolonged hunger. Sad,",
"but true. And these chaps, too,",
"had no earthly reason for any",
"kind of scruple. Restraint! I",
"would just as soon have expected",
"restraint from a hyena prowling",
"amongst the corpses of a",
"battlefield. But there was the",
"fact facing me—the fact dazzling,",
"to be seen, like the foam on the",
"depths of the sea, like a ripple",
"on an unfathomable enigma, a",
"mystery greater—when I thought of",
"it—than the curious, inexplicable",
"note of desperate grief in this",
"savage clamour that had swept by",
"us on the river-bank, behind the",
"blind whiteness of the fog.",
"“Two pilgrims were quarrelling in",
"hurried whispers as to which",
"bank. 'Left.' 'no, no; how can",
"you? Right, right, of course.'",
"'It is very serious,' said the",
"manager's voice behind me; 'I",
"would be desolated if anything",
"should happen to Mr. Kurtz before",
"we came up.' I looked at him, and",
"had not the slightest doubt he",
"was sincere. He was just the kind",
"of man who would wish to preserve",
"appearances. That was his",
"restraint. But when he muttered",
"something about going on at once,",
"I did not even take the trouble",
"to answer him. I knew, and he",
"knew, that it was impossible.",
"Were we to let go our hold of the",
"bottom, we would be absolutely in",
"the air—in space. We wouldn't be",
"able to tell where we were going",
"to—whether up or down stream, or",
"across—till we fetched against",
"one bank or the other—and then we",
"wouldn't know at first which it",
"was. Of course I made no move. I",
"had no mind for a smash-up. You",
"couldn't imagine a more deadly",
"place for a shipwreck. Whether we",
"drowned at once or not, we were",
"sure to perish speedily in one",
"way or another. 'I authorize you",
"to take all the risks,' he said,",
"after a short silence. 'I refuse",
"to take any,' I said shortly;",
"which was just the answer he",
"expected, though its tone might",
"have surprised him. 'Well, I must",
"defer to your judgment. You are",
"captain,' he said with marked",
"civility. I turned my shoulder to",
"him in sign of my appreciation,",
"and looked into the fog. How long",
"would it last? It was the most",
"hopeless lookout. The approach to",
"this Kurtz grubbing for ivory in",
"the wretched bush was beset by as",
"many dangers as though he had",
"been an enchanted princess",
"sleeping in a fabulous castle.",
"'Will they attack, do you think?'",
"asked the manager, in a",
"confidential tone.",
"“I did not think they would",
"attack, for several obvious",
"reasons. The thick fog was one.",
"If they left the bank in their",
"canoes they would get lost in it,",
"as we would be if we attempted to",
"move. Still, I had also judged",
"the jungle of both banks quite",
"impenetrable—and yet eyes were in",
"it, eyes that had seen us. The",
"riverside bushes were certainly",
"very thick; but the undergrowth",
"behind was evidently penetrable.",
"However, during the short lift I",
"had seen no canoes anywhere in",
"the reach—certainly not abreast",
"of the steamer. But what made the",
"idea of attack inconceivable to",
"me was the nature of the noise—of",
"the cries we had heard. They had",
"not the fierce character boding",
"immediate hostile intention.",
"Unexpected, wild, and violent as",
"they had been, they had given me",
"an irresistible impression of",
"sorrow. The glimpse of the",
"steamboat had for some reason",
"filled those savages with",
"unrestrained grief. The danger,",
"if any, I expounded, was from our",
"proximity to a great human",
"passion let loose. Even extreme",
"grief may ultimately vent itself",
"in violence—but more generally",
"takes the form of apathy....",
"“You should have seen the",
"pilgrims stare! They had no heart",
"to grin, or even to revile me:",
"but I believe they thought me",
"gone mad—with fright, maybe. I",
"delivered a regular lecture. My",
"dear boys, it was no good",
"bothering. Keep a lookout? Well,",
"you may guess I watched the fog",
"for the signs of lifting as a cat",
"watches a mouse; but for anything",
"else our eyes were of no more use",
"to us than if we had been buried",
"miles deep in a heap of",
"cotton-wool. It felt like it,",
"too—choking, warm, stifling.",
"Besides, all I said, though it",
"sounded extravagant, was",
"absolutely true to fact. What we",
"afterwards alluded to as an",
"attack was really an attempt at",
"repulse. The action was very far",
"from being aggressive—it was not",
"even defensive, in the usual",
"sense: it was undertaken under",
"the stress of desperation, and in",
"its essence was purely",
"protective.",
"“It developed itself, I should",
"say, two hours after the fog",
"lifted, and its commencement was",
"at a spot, roughly speaking,",
"about a mile and a half below",
"Kurtz's station. We had just",
"floundered and flopped round a",
"bend, when I saw an islet, a mere",
"grassy hummock of bright green,",
"in the middle of the stream. It",
"was the only thing of the kind;",
"but as we opened the reach more,",
"I perceived it was the head of a",
"long sand-bank, or rather of a",
"chain of shallow patches",
"stretching down the middle of the",
"river. They were discoloured,",
"just awash, and the whole lot was",
"seen just under the water,",
"exactly as a man's backbone is",
"seen running down the middle of",
"his back under the skin. Now, as",
"far as I did see, I could go to",
"the right or to the left of this.",
"I didn't know either channel, of",
"course. The banks looked pretty",
"well alike, the depth appeared",
"the same; but as I had been",
"informed the station was on the",
"west side, I naturally headed for",
"the western passage.",
"“No sooner had we fairly entered",
"it than I became aware it was",
"much narrower than I had",
"supposed. To the left of us there",
"was the long uninterrupted shoal,",
"and to the right a high, steep",
"bank heavily overgrown with",
"bushes. Above the bush the trees",
"stood in serried ranks. The twigs",
"overhung the current thickly, and",
"from distance to distance a large",
"limb of some tree projected",
"rigidly over the stream. It was",
"then well on in the afternoon,",
"the face of the forest was",
"gloomy, and a broad strip of",
"shadow had already fallen on the",
"water. In this shadow we steamed",
"up—very slowly, as you may",
"imagine. I sheered her well",
"inshore—the water being deepest",
"near the bank, as the",
"sounding-pole informed me.",
"“One of my hungry and forbearing",
"friends was sounding in the bows",
"just below me. This steamboat was",
"exactly like a decked scow. On",
"the deck, there were two little",
"teakwood houses, with doors and",
"windows. The boiler was in the",
"fore-end, and the machinery right",
"astern. Over the whole there was",
"a light roof, supported on",
"stanchions. The funnel projected",
"through that roof, and in front",
"of the funnel a small cabin built",
"of light planks served for a",
"pilot-house. It contained a",
"couch, two camp-stools, a loaded",
"Martini-Henry leaning in one",
"corner, a tiny table, and the",
"steering-wheel. It had a wide",
"door in front and a broad shutter",
"at each side. All these were",
"always thrown open, of course. I",
"spent my days perched up there on",
"the extreme fore-end of that",
"roof, before the door. At night I",
"slept, or tried to, on the couch.",
"An athletic black belonging to",
"some coast tribe and educated by",
"my poor predecessor, was the",
"helmsman. He sported a pair of",
"brass earrings, wore a blue cloth",
"wrapper from the waist to the",
"ankles, and thought all the world",
"of himself. He was the most",
"unstable kind of fool I had ever",
"seen. He steered with no end of a",
"swagger while you were by; but if",
"he lost sight of you, he became",
"instantly the prey of an abject",
"funk, and would let that cripple",
"of a steamboat get the upper hand",
"of him in a minute.",
"“I was looking down at the",
"sounding-pole, and feeling much",
"annoyed to see at each try a",
"little more of it stick out of",
"that river, when I saw my poleman",
"give up on the business suddenly,",
"and stretch himself flat on the",
"deck, without even taking the",
"trouble to haul his pole in. He",
"kept hold on it though, and it",
"trailed in the water. At the same",
"time the fireman, whom I could",
"also see below me, sat down",
"abruptly before his furnace and",
"ducked his head. I was amazed.",
"Then I had to look at the river",
"mighty quick, because there was a",
"snag in the fairway. Sticks,",
"little sticks, were flying",
"about—thick: they were whizzing",
"before my nose, dropping below",
"me, striking behind me against my",
"pilot-house. All this time the",
"river, the shore, the woods, were",
"very quiet—perfectly quiet. I",
"could only hear the heavy",
"splashing thump of the",
"stern-wheel and the patter of",
"these things. We cleared the snag",
"clumsily. Arrows, by Jove! We",
"were being shot at! I stepped in",
"quickly to close the shutter on",
"the landside. That fool-helmsman,",
"his hands on the spokes, was",
"lifting his knees high, stamping",
"his feet, champing his mouth,",
"like a reined-in horse. Confound",
"him! And we were staggering",
"within ten feet of the bank. I",
"had to lean right out to swing",
"the heavy shutter, and I saw a",
"face amongst the leaves on the",
"level with my own, looking at me",
"very fierce and steady; and then",
"suddenly, as though a veil had",
"been removed from my eyes, I made",
"out, deep in the tangled gloom,",
"naked breasts, arms, legs,",
"glaring eyes—the bush was",
"swarming with human limbs in",
"movement, glistening of bronze",
"colour. The twigs shook, swayed,",
"and rustled, the arrows flew out",
"of them, and then the shutter",
"came to. 'Steer her straight,' I",
"said to the helmsman. He held his",
"head rigid, face forward; but his",
"eyes rolled, he kept on lifting",
"and setting down his feet gently,",
"his mouth foamed a little. 'Keep",
"quiet!' I said in a fury. I might",
"just as well have ordered a tree",
"not to sway in the wind. I darted",
"out. Below me there was a great",
"scuffle of feet on the iron deck;",
"confused exclamations; a voice",
"screamed, 'Can you turn back?' I",
"caught sight of a V-shaped ripple",
"on the water ahead. What? Another",
"snag! A fusillade burst out under",
"my feet. The pilgrims had opened",
"with their Winchesters, and were",
"simply squirting lead into that",
"bush. A deuce of a lot of smoke",
"came up and drove slowly forward.",
"I swore at it. Now I couldn't see",
"the ripple or the snag either. I",
"stood in the doorway, peering,",
"and the arrows came in swarms.",
"They might have been poisoned,",
"but they looked as though they",
"wouldn't kill a cat. The bush",
"began to howl. Our wood-cutters",
"raised a warlike whoop; the",
"report of a rifle just at my back",
"deafened me. I glanced over my",
"shoulder, and the pilot-house was",
"yet full of noise and smoke when",
"I made a dash at the wheel. The",
"fool-nigger had dropped",
"everything, to throw the shutter",
"open and let off that",
"Martini-Henry. He stood before",
"the wide opening, glaring, and I",
"yelled at him to come back, while",
"I straightened the sudden twist",
"out of that steamboat. There was",
"no room to turn even if I had",
"wanted to, the snag was somewhere",
"very near ahead in that",
"confounded smoke, there was no",
"time to lose, so I just crowded",
"her into the bank—right into the",
"bank, where I knew the water was",
"deep.",
"“We tore slowly along the",
"overhanging bushes in a whirl of",
"broken twigs and flying leaves.",
"The fusillade below stopped",
"short, as I had foreseen it would",
"when the squirts got empty. I",
"threw my head back to a glinting",
"whizz that traversed the",
"pilot-house, in at one",
"shutter-hole and out at the",
"other. Looking past that mad",
"helmsman, who was shaking the",
"empty rifle and yelling at the",
"shore, I saw vague forms of men",
"running bent double, leaping,",
"gliding, distinct, incomplete,",
"evanescent. Something big",
"appeared in the air before the",
"shutter, the rifle went",
"overboard, and the man stepped",
"back swiftly, looked at me over",
"his shoulder in an extraordinary,",
"profound, familiar manner, and",
"fell upon my feet. The side of",
"his head hit the wheel twice, and",
"the end of what appeared a long",
"cane clattered round and knocked",
"over a little camp-stool. It",
"looked as though after wrenching",
"that thing from somebody ashore",
"he had lost his balance in the",
"effort. The thin smoke had blown",
"away, we were clear of the snag,",
"and looking ahead I could see",
"that in another hundred yards or",
"so I would be free to sheer off,",
"away from the bank; but my feet",
"felt so very warm and wet that I",
"had to look down. The man had",
"rolled on his back and stared",
"straight up at me; both his hands",
"clutched that cane. It was the",
"shaft of a spear that, either",
"thrown or lunged through the",
"opening, had caught him in the",
"side, just below the ribs; the",
"blade had gone in out of sight,",
"after making a frightful gash; my",
"shoes were full; a pool of blood",
"lay very still, gleaming dark-red",
"under the wheel; his eyes shone",
"with an amazing lustre. The",
"fusillade burst out again. He",
"looked at me anxiously, gripping",
"the spear like something",
"precious, with an air of being",
"afraid I would try to take it",
"away from him. I had to make an",
"effort to free my eyes from his",
"gaze and attend to the steering.",
"With one hand I felt above my",
"head for the line of the steam",
"whistle, and jerked out screech",
"after screech hurriedly. The",
"tumult of angry and warlike yells",
"was checked instantly, and then",
"from the depths of the woods went",
"out such a tremulous and",
"prolonged wail of mournful fear",
"and utter despair as may be",
"imagined to follow the flight of",
"the last hope from the earth.",
"There was a great commotion in",
"the bush; the shower of arrows",
"stopped, a few dropping shots",
"rang out sharply—then silence, in",
"which the languid beat of the",
"stern-wheel came plainly to my",
"ears. I put the helm hard",
"a-starboard at the moment when",
"the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very",
"hot and agitated, appeared in the",
"doorway. 'The manager sends me—'",
"he began in an official tone, and",
"stopped short. 'Good God!' he",
"said, glaring at the wounded man.",
"“We two whites stood over him,",
"and his lustrous and inquiring",
"glance enveloped us both. I",
"declare it looked as though he",
"would presently put to us some",
"questions in an understandable",
"language; but he died without",
"uttering a sound, without moving",
"a limb, without twitching a",
"muscle. Only in the very last",
"moment, as though in response to",
"some sign we could not see, to",
"some whisper we could not hear,",
"he frowned heavily, and that",
"frown gave to his black",
"death-mask an inconceivably",
"sombre, brooding, and menacing",
"expression. The lustre of",
"inquiring glance faded swiftly",
"into vacant glassiness. 'Can you",
"steer?' I asked the agent",
"eagerly. He looked very dubious;",
"but I made a grab at his arm, and",
"he understood at once I meant him",
"to steer whether or no. To tell",
"you the truth, I was morbidly",
"anxious to change my shoes and",
"socks. 'He is dead,' murmured the",
"fellow, immensely impressed. 'No",
"doubt about it,' said I, tugging",
"like mad at the shoe-laces. 'And",
"by the way, I suppose Mr. Kurtz",
"is dead as well by this time.'",
"“For the moment that was the",
"dominant thought. There was a",
"sense of extreme disappointment,",
"as though I had found out I had",
"been striving after something",
"altogether without a substance. I",
"couldn't have been more disgusted",
"if I had travelled all this way",
"for the sole purpose of talking",
"with Mr. Kurtz. Talking with... I",
"flung one shoe overboard, and",
"became aware that that was",
"exactly what I had been looking",
"forward to—a talk with Kurtz. I",
"made the strange discovery that I",
"had never imagined him as doing,",
"you know, but as discoursing. I",
"didn't say to myself, 'Now I will",
"never see him,' or 'Now I will",
"never shake him by the hand,'",
"but, 'Now I will never hear him.'",
"The man presented himself as a",
"voice. Not of course that I did",
"not connect him with some sort of",
"action. Hadn't I been told in all",
"the tones of jealousy and",
"admiration that he had collected,",
"bartered, swindled, or stolen",
"more ivory than all the other",
"agents together? That was not the",
"point. The point was in his being",
"a gifted creature, and that of",
"all his gifts the one that stood",
"out preeminently, that carried",
"with it a sense of real presence,",
"was his ability to talk, his",
"words—the gift of expression, the",
"bewildering, the illuminating,",
"the most exalted and the most",
"contemptible, the pulsating",
"stream of light, or the deceitful",
"flow from the heart of an",
"impenetrable darkness.",
"“The other shoe went flying unto",
"the devil-god of that river. I",
"thought, 'By Jove! it's all over.",
"We are too late; he has",
"vanished—the gift has vanished,",
"by means of some spear, arrow, or",
"club. I will never hear that chap",
"speak after all'—and my sorrow",
"had a startling extravagance of",
"emotion, even such as I had",
"noticed in the howling sorrow of",
"these savages in the bush. I",
"couldn't have felt more of lonely",
"desolation somehow, had I been",
"robbed of a belief or had missed",
"my destiny in life.... Why do you",
"sigh in this beastly way,",
"somebody? Absurd? Well, absurd.",
"Good Lord! mustn't a man",
"ever—Here, give me some",
"tobacco.”...",
"There was a pause of profound",
"stillness, then a match flared,",
"and Marlow's lean face appeared,",
"worn, hollow, with downward folds",
"and dropped eyelids, with an",
"aspect of concentrated attention;",
"and as he took vigorous draws at",
"his pipe, it seemed to retreat",
"and advance out of the night in",
"the regular flicker of tiny",
"flame. The match went out.",
"“Absurd!” he cried. “This is the",
"worst of trying to tell.... Here",
"you all are, each moored with two",
"good addresses, like a hulk with",
"two anchors, a butcher round one",
"corner, a policeman round",
"another, excellent appetites, and",
"temperature normal—you",
"hear—normal from year's end to",
"year's end. And you say, Absurd!",
"Absurd be—exploded! Absurd! My",
"dear boys, what can you expect",
"from a man who out of sheer",
"nervousness had just flung",
"overboard a pair of new shoes!",
"Now I think of it, it is amazing",
"I did not shed tears. I am, upon",
"the whole, proud of my fortitude.",
"I was cut to the quick at the",
"idea of having lost the",
"inestimable privilege of",
"listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of",
"course I was wrong. The privilege",
"was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I",
"heard more than enough. And I was",
"right, too. A voice. He was very",
"little more than a voice. And I",
"heard—him—it—this voice—other",
"voices—all of them were so little",
"more than voices—and the memory",
"of that time itself lingers",
"around me, impalpable, like a",
"dying vibration of one immense",
"jabber, silly, atrocious, sordid,",
"savage, or simply mean, without",
"any kind of sense. Voices,",
"voices—even the girl",
"herself—now—”",
"He was silent for a long time.",
"“I laid the ghost of his gifts at",
"last with a lie,” he began,",
"suddenly. “Girl! What? Did I",
"mention a girl? Oh, she is out of",
"it—completely. They—the women, I",
"mean—are out of it—should be out",
"of it. We must help them to stay",
"in that beautiful world of their",
"own, lest ours gets worse. Oh,",
"she had to be out of it. You",
"should have heard the disinterred",
"body of Mr. Kurtz saying, 'My",
"Intended.' You would have",
"perceived directly then how",
"completely she was out of it. And",
"the lofty frontal bone of Mr.",
"Kurtz! They say the hair goes on",
"growing sometimes, but",
"this—ah—specimen, was",
"impressively bald. The wilderness",
"had patted him on the head, and,",
"behold, it was like a ball—an",
"ivory ball; it had caressed him,",
"and—lo!—he had withered; it had",
"taken him, loved him, embraced",
"him, got into his veins, consumed",
"his flesh, and sealed his soul to",
"its own by the inconceivable",
"ceremonies of some devilish",
"initiation. He was its spoiled",
"and pampered favourite. Ivory? I",
"should think so. Heaps of it,",
"stacks of it. The old mud shanty",
"was bursting with it. You would",
"think there was not a single tusk",
"left either above or below the",
"ground in the whole country.",
"'Mostly fossil,' the manager had",
"remarked, disparagingly. It was",
"no more fossil than I am; but",
"they call it fossil when it is",
"dug up. It appears these niggers",
"do bury the tusks sometimes—but",
"evidently they couldn't bury this",
"parcel deep enough to save the",
"gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate.",
"We filled the steamboat with it,",
"and had to pile a lot on the",
"deck. Thus he could see and enjoy",
"as long as he could see, because",
"the appreciation of this favour",
"had remained with him to the",
"last. You should have heard him",
"say, 'My ivory.' Oh, yes, I heard",
"him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my",
"station, my river, my—'",
"everything belonged to him. It",
"made me hold my breath in",
"expectation of hearing the",
"wilderness burst into a",
"prodigious peal of laughter that",
"would shake the fixed stars in",
"their places. Everything belonged",
"to him—but that was a trifle. The",
"thing was to know what he",
"belonged to, how many powers of",
"darkness claimed him for their",
"own. That was the reflection that",
"made you creepy all over. It was",
"impossible—it was not good for",
"one either—trying to imagine. He",
"had taken a high seat amongst the",
"devils of the land—I mean",
"literally. You can't understand.",
"How could you?—with solid",
"pavement under your feet,",
"surrounded by kind neighbours",
"ready to cheer you or to fall on",
"you, stepping delicately between",
"the butcher and the policeman, in",
"the holy terror of scandal and",
"gallows and lunatic asylums—how",
"can you imagine what particular",
"region of the first ages a man's",
"untrammelled feet may take him",
"into by the way of solitude—utter",
"solitude without a policeman—by",
"the way of silence—utter silence,",
"where no warning voice of a kind",
"neighbour can be heard whispering",
"of public opinion? These little",
"things make all the great",
"difference. When they are gone",
"you must fall back upon your own",
"innate strength, upon your own",
"capacity for faithfulness. Of",
"course you may be too much of a",
"fool to go wrong—too dull even to",
"know you are being assaulted by",
"the powers of darkness. I take",
"it, no fool ever made a bargain",
"for his soul with the devil; the",
"fool is too much of a fool, or",
"the devil too much of a devil—I",
"don't know which. Or you may be",
"such a thunderingly exalted",
"creature as to be altogether deaf",
"and blind to anything but",
"heavenly sights and sounds. Then",
"the earth for you is only a",
"standing place—and whether to be",
"like this is your loss or your",
"gain I won't pretend to say. But",
"most of us are neither one nor",
"the other. The earth for us is a",
"place to live in, where we must",
"put up with sights, with sounds,",
"with smells, too, by",
"Jove!—breathe dead hippo, so to",
"speak, and not be contaminated.",
"And there, don't you see? Your",
"strength comes in, the faith in",
"your ability for the digging of",
"unostentatious holes to bury the",
"stuff in—your power of devotion,",
"not to yourself, but to an",
"obscure, back-breaking business.",
"And that's difficult enough.",
"Mind, I am not trying to excuse",
"or even explain—I am trying to",
"account to myself for—for—Mr.",
"Kurtz—for the shade of Mr. Kurtz.",
"This initiated wraith from the",
"back of Nowhere honoured me with",
"its amazing confidence before it",
"vanished altogether. This was",
"because it could speak English to",
"me. The original Kurtz had been",
"educated partly in England,",
"and—as he was good enough to say",
"himself—his sympathies were in",
"the right place. His mother was",
"half-English, his father was",
"half-French. All Europe",
"contributed to the making of",
"Kurtz; and by and by I learned",
"that, most appropriately, the",
"International Society for the",
"Suppression of Savage Customs had",
"intrusted him with the making of",
"a report, for its future",
"guidance. And he had written it,",
"too. I've seen it. I've read it.",
"It was eloquent, vibrating with",
"eloquence, but too high-strung, I",
"think. Seventeen pages of close",
"writing he had found time for!",
"But this must have been before",
"his—let us say—nerves, went",
"wrong, and caused him to preside",
"at certain midnight dances ending",
"with unspeakable rites, which—as",
"far as I reluctantly gathered",
"from what I heard at various",
"times—were offered up to him—do",
"you understand?—to Mr. Kurtz",
"himself. But it was a beautiful",
"piece of writing. The opening",
"paragraph, however, in the light",
"of later information, strikes me",
"now as ominous. He began with the",
"argument that we whites, from the",
"point of development we had",
"arrived at, 'must necessarily",
"appear to them [savages] in the",
"nature of supernatural beings—we",
"approach them with the might of a",
"deity,' and so on, and so on. 'By",
"the simple exercise of our will",
"we can exert a power for good",
"practically unbounded,' etc.,",
"etc. From that point he soared",
"and took me with him. The",
"peroration was magnificent,",
"though difficult to remember, you",
"know. It gave me the notion of an",
"exotic Immensity ruled by an",
"august Benevolence. It made me",
"tingle with enthusiasm. This was",
"the unbounded power of",
"eloquence—of words—of burning",
"noble words. There were no",
"practical hints to interrupt the",
"magic current of phrases, unless",
"a kind of note at the foot of the",
"last page, scrawled evidently",
"much later, in an unsteady hand,",
"may be regarded as the exposition",
"of a method. It was very simple,",
"and at the end of that moving",
"appeal to every altruistic",
"sentiment it blazed at you,",
"luminous and terrifying, like a",
"flash of lightning in a serene",
"sky: 'Exterminate all the",
"brutes!' The curious part was",
"that he had apparently forgotten",
"all about that valuable",
"postscriptum, because, later on,",
"when he in a sense came to",
"himself, he repeatedly entreated",
"me to take good care of 'my",
"pamphlet' (he called it), as it",
"was sure to have in the future a",
"good influence upon his career. I",
"had full information about all",
"these things, and, besides, as it",
"turned out, I was to have the",
"care of his memory. I've done",
"enough for it to give me the",
"indisputable right to lay it, if",
"I choose, for an everlasting rest",
"in the dust-bin of progress,",
"amongst all the sweepings and,",
"figuratively speaking, all the",
"dead cats of civilization. But",
"then, you see, I can't choose. He",
"won't be forgotten. Whatever he",
"was, he was not common. He had",
"the power to charm or frighten",
"rudimentary souls into an",
"aggravated witch-dance in his",
"honour; he could also fill the",
"small souls of the pilgrims with",
"bitter misgivings: he had one",
"devoted friend at least, and he",
"had conquered one soul in the",
"world that was neither",
"rudimentary nor tainted with",
"self-seeking. No; I can't forget",
"him, though I am not prepared to",
"affirm the fellow was exactly",
"worth the life we lost in getting",
"to him. I missed my late helmsman",
"awfully—I missed him even while",
"his body was still lying in the",
"pilot-house. Perhaps you will",
"think it passing strange this",
"regret for a savage who was no",
"more account than a grain of sand",
"in a black Sahara. Well, don't",
"you see, he had done something,",
"he had steered; for months I had",
"him at my back—a help—an",
"instrument. It was a kind of",
"partnership. He steered for me—I",
"had to look after him, I worried",
"about his deficiencies, and thus",
"a subtle bond had been created,",
"of which I only became aware when",
"it was suddenly broken. And the",
"intimate profundity of that look",
"he gave me when he received his",
"hurt remains to this day in my",
"memory—like a claim of distant",
"kinship affirmed in a supreme",
"moment.",
"“Poor fool! If he had only left",
"that shutter alone. He had no",
"restraint, no restraint—just like",
"Kurtz—a tree swayed by the wind.",
"As soon as I had put on a dry",
"pair of slippers, I dragged him",
"out, after first jerking the",
"spear out of his side, which",
"operation I confess I performed",
"with my eyes shut tight. His",
"heels leaped together over the",
"little doorstep; his shoulders",
"were pressed to my breast; I",
"hugged him from behind",
"desperately. Oh! he was heavy,",
"heavy; heavier than any man on",
"earth, I should imagine. Then",
"without more ado I tipped him",
"overboard. The current snatched",
"him as though he had been a wisp",
"of grass, and I saw the body roll",
"over twice before I lost sight of",
"it for ever. All the pilgrims and",
"the manager were then congregated",
"on the awning-deck about the",
"pilot-house, chattering at each",
"other like a flock of excited",
"magpies, and there was a",
"scandalized murmur at my",
"heartless promptitude. What they",
"wanted to keep that body hanging",
"about for I can't guess. Embalm",
"it, maybe. But I had also heard",
"another, and a very ominous,",
"murmur on the deck below. My",
"friends the wood-cutters were",
"likewise scandalized, and with a",
"better show of reason—though I",
"admit that the reason itself was",
"quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I",
"had made up my mind that if my",
"late helmsman was to be eaten,",
"the fishes alone should have him.",
"He had been a very second-rate",
"helmsman while alive, but now he",
"was dead he might have become a",
"first-class temptation, and",
"possibly cause some startling",
"trouble. Besides, I was anxious",
"to take the wheel, the man in",
"pink pyjamas showing himself a",
"hopeless duffer at the business.",
"“This I did directly the simple",
"funeral was over. We were going",
"half-speed, keeping right in the",
"middle of the stream, and I",
"listened to the talk about me.",
"They had given up Kurtz, they had",
"given up the station; Kurtz was",
"dead, and the station had been",
"burnt—and so on—and so on. The",
"red-haired pilgrim was beside",
"himself with the thought that at",
"least this poor Kurtz had been",
"properly avenged. 'Say! We must",
"have made a glorious slaughter of",
"them in the bush. Eh? What do you",
"think? Say?' He positively",
"danced, the bloodthirsty little",
"gingery beggar. And he had nearly",
"fainted when he saw the wounded",
"man! I could not help saying,",
"'You made a glorious lot of",
"smoke, anyhow.' I had seen, from",
"the way the tops of the bushes",
"rustled and flew, that almost all",
"the shots had gone too high. You",
"can't hit anything unless you",
"take aim and fire from the",
"shoulder; but these chaps fired",
"from the hip with their eyes",
"shut. The retreat, I",
"maintained—and I was right—was",
"caused by the screeching of the",
"steam whistle. Upon this they",
"forgot Kurtz, and began to howl",
"at me with indignant protests.",
"“The manager stood by the wheel",
"murmuring confidentially about",
"the necessity of getting well",
"away down the river before dark",
"at all events, when I saw in the",
"distance a clearing on the",
"riverside and the outlines of",
"some sort of building. 'What's",
"this?' I asked. He clapped his",
"hands in wonder. 'The station!'",
"he cried. I edged in at once,",
"still going half-speed.",
"“Through my glasses I saw the",
"slope of a hill interspersed with",
"rare trees and perfectly free",
"from undergrowth. A long decaying",
"building on the summit was half",
"buried in the high grass; the",
"large holes in the peaked roof",
"gaped black from afar; the jungle",
"and the woods made a background.",
"There was no enclosure or fence",
"of any kind; but there had been",
"one apparently, for near the",
"house half-a-dozen slim posts",
"remained in a row, roughly",
"trimmed, and with their upper",
"ends ornamented with round carved",
"balls. The rails, or whatever",
"there had been between, had",
"disappeared. Of course the forest",
"surrounded all that. The",
"river-bank was clear, and on the",
"waterside I saw a white man under",
"a hat like a cart-wheel beckoning",
"persistently with his whole arm.",
"Examining the edge of the forest",
"above and below, I was almost",
"certain I could see",
"movements—human forms gliding",
"here and there. I steamed past",
"prudently, then stopped the",
"engines and let her drift down.",
"The man on the shore began to",
"shout, urging us to land. 'We",
"have been attacked,' screamed the",
"manager. 'I know—I know. It's all",
"right,' yelled back the other, as",
"cheerful as you please. 'Come",
"along. It's all right. I am",
"glad.'",
"“His aspect reminded me of",
"something I had seen—something",
"funny I had seen somewhere. As I",
"manoeuvred to get alongside, I",
"was asking myself, 'What does",
"this fellow look like?' Suddenly",
"I got it. He looked like a",
"harlequin. His clothes had been",
"made of some stuff that was brown",
"holland probably, but it was",
"covered with patches all over,",
"with bright patches, blue, red,",
"and yellow—patches on the back,",
"patches on the front, patches on",
"elbows, on knees; coloured",
"binding around his jacket,",
"scarlet edging at the bottom of",
"his trousers; and the sunshine",
"made him look extremely gay and",
"wonderfully neat withal, because",
"you could see how beautifully all",
"this patching had been done. A",
"beardless, boyish face, very",
"fair, no features to speak of,",
"nose peeling, little blue eyes,",
"smiles and frowns chasing each",
"other over that open countenance",
"like sunshine and shadow on a",
"wind-swept plain. 'Look out,",
"captain!' he cried; 'there's a",
"snag lodged in here last night.'",
"What! Another snag? I confess I",
"swore shamefully. I had nearly",
"holed my cripple, to finish off",
"that charming trip. The harlequin",
"on the bank turned his little",
"pug-nose up to me. 'You English?'",
"he asked, all smiles. 'Are you?'",
"I shouted from the wheel. The",
"smiles vanished, and he shook his",
"head as if sorry for my",
"disappointment. Then he",
"brightened up. 'Never mind!' he",
"cried encouragingly. 'Are we in",
"time?' I asked. 'He is up there,'",
"he replied, with a toss of the",
"head up the hill, and becoming",
"gloomy all of a sudden. His face",
"was like the autumn sky, overcast",
"one moment and bright the next.",
"“When the manager, escorted by",
"the pilgrims, all of them armed",
"to the teeth, had gone to the",
"house this chap came on board. 'I",
"say, I don't like this. These",
"natives are in the bush,' I said.",
"He assured me earnestly it was",
"all right. 'They are simple",
"people,' he added; 'well, I am",
"glad you came. It took me all my",
"time to keep them off.' 'But you",
"said it was all right,' I cried.",
"'Oh, they meant no harm,' he",
"said; and as I stared he",
"corrected himself, 'Not exactly.'",
"Then vivaciously, 'My faith, your",
"pilot-house wants a clean-up!' In",
"the next breath he advised me to",
"keep enough steam on the boiler",
"to blow the whistle in case of",
"any trouble. 'One good screech",
"will do more for you than all",
"your rifles. They are simple",
"people,' he repeated. He rattled",
"away at such a rate he quite",
"overwhelmed me. He seemed to be",
"trying to make up for lots of",
"silence, and actually hinted,",
"laughing, that such was the case.",
"'Don't you talk with Mr. Kurtz?'",
"I said. 'You don't talk with that",
"man—you listen to him,' he",
"exclaimed with severe exaltation.",
"'But now—' He waved his arm, and",
"in the twinkling of an eye was in",
"the uttermost depths of",
"despondency. In a moment he came",
"up again with a jump, possessed",
"himself of both my hands, shook",
"them continuously, while he",
"gabbled: 'Brother sailor...",
"honour... pleasure... delight...",
"introduce myself... Russian...",
"son of an arch-priest...",
"Government of Tambov... What?",
"Tobacco! English tobacco; the",
"excellent English tobacco! Now,",
"that's brotherly. Smoke? Where's",
"a sailor that does not smoke?”",
"“The pipe soothed him, and",
"gradually I made out he had run",
"away from school, had gone to sea",
"in a Russian ship; ran away",
"again; served some time in",
"English ships; was now reconciled",
"with the arch-priest. He made a",
"point of that. 'But when one is",
"young one must see things, gather",
"experience, ideas; enlarge the",
"mind.' 'Here!' I interrupted.",
"'You can never tell! Here I met",
"Mr. Kurtz,' he said, youthfully",
"solemn and reproachful. I held my",
"tongue after that. It appears he",
"had persuaded a Dutch",
"trading-house on the coast to fit",
"him out with stores and goods,",
"and had started for the interior",
"with a light heart and no more",
"idea of what would happen to him",
"than a baby. He had been",
"wandering about that river for",
"nearly two years alone, cut off",
"from everybody and everything. 'I",
"am not so young as I look. I am",
"twenty-five,' he said. 'At first",
"old Van Shuyten would tell me to",
"go to the devil,' he narrated",
"with keen enjoyment; 'but I stuck",
"to him, and talked and talked,",
"till at last he got afraid I",
"would talk the hind-leg off his",
"favourite dog, so he gave me some",
"cheap things and a few guns, and",
"told me he hoped he would never",
"see my face again. Good old",
"Dutchman, Van Shuyten. I've sent",
"him one small lot of ivory a year",
"ago, so that he can't call me a",
"little thief when I get back. I",
"hope he got it. And for the rest",
"I don't care. I had some wood",
"stacked for you. That was my old",
"house. Did you see?'",
"“I gave him Towson's book. He",
"made as though he would kiss me,",
"but restrained himself. 'The only",
"book I had left, and I thought I",
"had lost it,' he said, looking at",
"it ecstatically. 'So many",
"accidents happen to a man going",
"about alone, you know. Canoes get",
"upset sometimes—and sometimes",
"you've got to clear out so quick",
"when the people get angry.' He",
"thumbed the pages. 'You made",
"notes in Russian?' I asked. He",
"nodded. 'I thought they were",
"written in cipher,' I said. He",
"laughed, then became serious. 'I",
"had lots of trouble to keep these",
"people off,' he said. 'Did they",
"want to kill you?' I asked. 'Oh,",
"no!' he cried, and checked",
"himself. 'Why did they attack",
"us?' I pursued. He hesitated,",
"then said shamefacedly, 'They",
"don't want him to go.' 'Don't",
"they?' I said curiously. He",
"nodded a nod full of mystery and",
"wisdom. 'I tell you,' he cried,",
"'this man has enlarged my mind.'",
"He opened his arms wide, staring",
"at me with his little blue eyes",
"that were perfectly round.”",

"III",
"",
"“I looked at him, lost in",
"astonishment. There he was before",
"me, in motley, as though he had",
"absconded from a troupe of mimes,",
"enthusiastic, fabulous. His very",
"existence was improbable,",
"inexplicable, and altogether",
"bewildering. He was an insoluble",
"problem. It was inconceivable how",
"he had existed, how he had",
"succeeded in getting so far, how",
"he had managed to remain—why he",
"did not instantly disappear. 'I",
"went a little farther,' he said,",
"'then still a little farther—till",
"I had gone so far that I don't",
"know how I'll ever get back.",
"Never mind. Plenty time. I can",
"manage. You take Kurtz away",
"quick—quick—I tell you.' The",
"glamour of youth enveloped his",
"parti-coloured rags, his",
"destitution, his loneliness, the",
"essential desolation of his",
"futile wanderings. For months—for",
"years—his life hadn't been worth",
"a day's purchase; and there he",
"was gallantly, thoughtlessly",
"alive, to all appearances",
"indestructible solely by the",
"virtue of his few years and of",
"his unreflecting audacity. I was",
"seduced into something like",
"admiration—like envy. Glamour",
"urged him on, glamour kept him",
"unscathed. He surely wanted",
"nothing from the wilderness but",
"space to breathe in and to push",
"on through. His need was to",
"exist, and to move onwards at the",
"greatest possible risk, and with",
"a maximum of privation. If the",
"absolutely pure, uncalculating,",
"unpractical spirit of adventure",
"had ever ruled a human being, it",
"ruled this bepatched youth. I",
"almost envied him the possession",
"of this modest and clear flame.",
"It seemed to have consumed all",
"thought of self so completely,",
"that even while he was talking to",
"you, you forgot that it was",
"he—the man before your eyes—who",
"had gone through these things. I",
"did not envy him his devotion to",
"Kurtz, though. He had not",
"meditated over it. It came to",
"him, and he accepted it with a",
"sort of eager fatalism. I must",
"say that to me it appeared about",
"the most dangerous thing in every",
"way he had come upon so far.",
"“They had come together",
"unavoidably, like two ships",
"becalmed near each other, and lay",
"rubbing sides at last. I suppose",
"Kurtz wanted an audience, because",
"on a certain occasion, when",
"encamped in the forest, they had",
"talked all night, or more",
"probably Kurtz had talked. 'We",
"talked of everything,' he said,",
"quite transported at the",
"recollection. 'I forgot there was",
"such a thing as sleep. The night",
"did not seem to last an hour.",
"Everything! Everything!... Of",
"love, too.' 'Ah, he talked to you",
"of love!' I said, much amused.",
"'It isn't what you think,' he",
"cried, almost passionately. 'It",
"was in general. He made me see",
"things—things.'",
"“He threw his arms up. We were on",
"deck at the time, and the headman",
"of my wood-cutters, lounging near",
"by, turned upon him his heavy and",
"glittering eyes. I looked around,",
"and I don't know why, but I",
"assure you that never, never",
"before, did this land, this",
"river, this jungle, the very arch",
"of this blazing sky, appear to me",
"so hopeless and so dark, so",
"impenetrable to human thought, so",
"pitiless to human weakness. 'And,",
"ever since, you have been with",
"him, of course?' I said.",
"“On the contrary. It appears",
"their intercourse had been very",
"much broken by various causes. He",
"had, as he informed me proudly,",
"managed to nurse Kurtz through",
"two illnesses (he alluded to it",
"as you would to some risky feat),",
"but as a rule Kurtz wandered",
"alone, far in the depths of the",
"forest. 'Very often coming to",
"this station, I had to wait days",
"and days before he would turn",
"up,' he said. 'Ah, it was worth",
"waiting for!—sometimes.' 'What",
"was he doing? exploring or what?'",
"I asked. 'Oh, yes, of course'; he",
"had discovered lots of villages,",
"a lake, too—he did not know",
"exactly in what direction; it was",
"dangerous to inquire too much—but",
"mostly his expeditions had been",
"for ivory. 'But he had no goods",
"to trade with by that time,' I",
"objected. 'There's a good lot of",
"cartridges left even yet,' he",
"answered, looking away. 'To speak",
"plainly, he raided the country,'",
"I said. He nodded. 'Not alone,",
"surely!' He muttered something",
"about the villages round that",
"lake. 'Kurtz got the tribe to",
"follow him, did he?' I suggested.",
"He fidgeted a little. 'They",
"adored him,' he said. The tone of",
"these words was so extraordinary",
"that I looked at him searchingly.",
"It was curious to see his mingled",
"eagerness and reluctance to speak",
"of Kurtz. The man filled his",
"life, occupied his thoughts,",
"swayed his emotions. 'What can",
"you expect?' he burst out; 'he",
"came to them with thunder and",
"lightning, you know—and they had",
"never seen anything like it—and",
"very terrible. He could be very",
"terrible. You can't judge Mr.",
"Kurtz as you would an ordinary",
"man. No, no, no! Now—just to give",
"you an idea—I don't mind telling",
"you, he wanted to shoot me, too,",
"one day—but I don't judge him.'",
"'Shoot you!' I cried 'What for?'",
"'Well, I had a small lot of ivory",
"the chief of that village near my",
"house gave me. You see I used to",
"shoot game for them. Well, he",
"wanted it, and wouldn't hear",
"reason. He declared he would",
"shoot me unless I gave him the",
"ivory and then cleared out of the",
"country, because he could do so,",
"and had a fancy for it, and there",
"was nothing on earth to prevent",
"him killing whom he jolly well",
"pleased. And it was true, too. I",
"gave him the ivory. What did I",
"care! But I didn't clear out. No,",
"no. I couldn't leave him. I had",
"to be careful, of course, till we",
"got friendly again for a time. He",
"had his second illness then.",
"Afterwards I had to keep out of",
"the way; but I didn't mind. He",
"was living for the most part in",
"those villages on the lake. When",
"he came down to the river,",
"sometimes he would take to me,",
"and sometimes it was better for",
"me to be careful. This man",
"suffered too much. He hated all",
"this, and somehow he couldn't get",
"away. When I had a chance I",
"begged him to try and leave while",
"there was time; I offered to go",
"back with him. And he would say",
"yes, and then he would remain; go",
"off on another ivory hunt;",
"disappear for weeks; forget",
"himself amongst these",
"people—forget himself—you know.'",
"'Why! he's mad,' I said. He",
"protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz",
"couldn't be mad. If I had heard",
"him talk, only two days ago, I",
"wouldn't dare hint at such a",
"thing.... I had taken up my",
"binoculars while we talked, and",
"was looking at the shore,",
"sweeping the limit of the forest",
"at each side and at the back of",
"the house. The consciousness of",
"there being people in that bush,",
"so silent, so quiet—as silent and",
"quiet as the ruined house on the",
"hill—made me uneasy. There was no",
"sign on the face of nature of",
"this amazing tale that was not so",
"much told as suggested to me in",
"desolate exclamations, completed",
"by shrugs, in interrupted",
"phrases, in hints ending in deep",
"sighs. The woods were unmoved,",
"like a mask—heavy, like the",
"closed door of a prison—they",
"looked with their air of hidden",
"knowledge, of patient",
"expectation, of unapproachable",
"silence. The Russian was",
"explaining to me that it was only",
"lately that Mr. Kurtz had come",
"down to the river, bringing along",
"with him all the fighting men of",
"that lake tribe. He had been",
"absent for several months—getting",
"himself adored, I suppose—and had",
"come down unexpectedly, with the",
"intention to all appearance of",
"making a raid either across the",
"river or down stream. Evidently",
"the appetite for more ivory had",
"got the better of the—what shall",
"I say?—less material aspirations.",
"However he had got much worse",
"suddenly. 'I heard he was lying",
"helpless, and so I came up—took",
"my chance,' said the Russian.",
"'Oh, he is bad, very bad.' I",
"directed my glass to the house.",
"There were no signs of life, but",
"there was the ruined roof, the",
"long mud wall peeping above the",
"grass, with three little square",
"window-holes, no two of the same",
"size; all this brought within",
"reach of my hand, as it were. And",
"then I made a brusque movement,",
"and one of the remaining posts of",
"that vanished fence leaped up in",
"the field of my glass. You",
"remember I told you I had been",
"struck at the distance by certain",
"attempts at ornamentation, rather",
"remarkable in the ruinous aspect",
"of the place. Now I had suddenly",
"a nearer view, and its first",
"result was to make me throw my",
"head back as if before a blow.",
"Then I went carefully from post",
"to post with my glass, and I saw",
"my mistake. These round knobs",
"were not ornamental but symbolic;",
"they were expressive and",
"puzzling, striking and",
"disturbing—food for thought and",
"also for vultures if there had",
"been any looking down from the",
"sky; but at all events for such",
"ants as were industrious enough",
"to ascend the pole. They would",
"have been even more impressive,",
"those heads on the stakes, if",
"their faces had not been turned",
"to the house. Only one, the first",
"I had made out, was facing my",
"way. I was not so shocked as you",
"may think. The start back I had",
"given was really nothing but a",
"movement of surprise. I had",
"expected to see a knob of wood",
"there, you know. I returned",
"deliberately to the first I had",
"seen—and there it was, black,",
"dried, sunken, with closed",
"eyelids—a head that seemed to",
"sleep at the top of that pole,",
"and, with the shrunken dry lips",
"showing a narrow white line of",
"the teeth, was smiling, too,",
"smiling continuously at some",
"endless and jocose dream of that",
"eternal slumber.",
"“I am not disclosing any trade",
"secrets. In fact, the manager",
"said afterwards that Mr. Kurtz's",
"methods had ruined the district.",
"I have no opinion on that point,",
"but I want you clearly to",
"understand that there was nothing",
"exactly profitable in these heads",
"being there. They only showed",
"that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint",
"in the gratification of his",
"various lusts, that there was",
"something wanting in him—some",
"small matter which, when the",
"pressing need arose, could not be",
"found under his magnificent",
"eloquence. Whether he knew of",
"this deficiency himself I can't",
"say. I think the knowledge came",
"to him at last—only at the very",
"last. But the wilderness had",
"found him out early, and had",
"taken on him a terrible vengeance",
"for the fantastic invasion. I",
"think it had whispered to him",
"things about himself which he did",
"not know, things of which he had",
"no conception till he took",
"counsel with this great",
"solitude—and the whisper had",
"proved irresistibly fascinating.",
"It echoed loudly within him",
"because he was hollow at the",
"core.... I put down the glass,",
"and the head that had appeared",
"near enough to be spoken to",
"seemed at once to have leaped",
"away from me into inaccessible",
"distance.",
"“The admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a",
"bit crestfallen. In a hurried,",
"indistinct voice he began to",
"assure me he had not dared to",
"take these—say, symbols—down. He",
"was not afraid of the natives;",
"they would not stir till Mr.",
"Kurtz gave the word. His",
"ascendancy was extraordinary. The",
"camps of these people surrounded",
"the place, and the chiefs came",
"every day to see him. They would",
"crawl.... 'I don't want to know",
"anything of the ceremonies used",
"when approaching Mr. Kurtz,' I",
"shouted. Curious, this feeling",
"that came over me that such",
"details would be more intolerable",
"than those heads drying on the",
"stakes under Mr. Kurtz's windows.",
"After all, that was only a savage",
"sight, while I seemed at one",
"bound to have been transported",
"into some lightless region of",
"subtle horrors, where pure,",
"uncomplicated savagery was a",
"positive relief, being something",
"that had a right to",
"exist—obviously—in the sunshine.",
"The young man looked at me with",
"surprise. I suppose it did not",
"occur to him that Mr. Kurtz was",
"no idol of mine. He forgot I",
"hadn't heard any of these",
"splendid monologues on, what was",
"it? on love, justice, conduct of",
"life—or what not. If it had come",
"to crawling before Mr. Kurtz, he",
"crawled as much as the veriest",
"savage of them all. I had no idea",
"of the conditions, he said: these",
"heads were the heads of rebels. I",
"shocked him excessively by",
"laughing. Rebels! What would be",
"the next definition I was to",
"hear? There had been enemies,",
"criminals, workers—and these were",
"rebels. Those rebellious heads",
"looked very subdued to me on",
"their sticks. 'You don't know how",
"such a life tries a man like",
"Kurtz,' cried Kurtz's last",
"disciple. 'Well, and you?' I",
"said. 'I! I! I am a simple man. I",
"have no great thoughts. I want",
"nothing from anybody. How can you",
"compare me to...?' His feelings",
"were too much for speech, and",
"suddenly he broke down. 'I don't",
"understand,' he groaned. 'I've",
"been doing my best to keep him",
"alive, and that's enough. I had",
"no hand in all this. I have no",
"abilities. There hasn't been a",
"drop of medicine or a mouthful of",
"invalid food for months here. He",
"was shamefully abandoned. A man",
"like this, with such ideas.",
"Shamefully! Shamefully!",
"I—I—haven't slept for the last",
"ten nights...'",
"“His voice lost itself in the",
"calm of the evening. The long",
"shadows of the forest had slipped",
"downhill while we talked, had",
"gone far beyond the ruined hovel,",
"beyond the symbolic row of",
"stakes. All this was in the",
"gloom, while we down there were",
"yet in the sunshine, and the",
"stretch of the river abreast of",
"the clearing glittered in a still",
"and dazzling splendour, with a",
"murky and overshadowed bend above",
"and below. Not a living soul was",
"seen on the shore. The bushes did",
"not rustle.",
"“Suddenly round the corner of the",
"house a group of men appeared, as",
"though they had come up from the",
"ground. They waded waist-deep in",
"the grass, in a compact body,",
"bearing an improvised stretcher",
"in their midst. Instantly, in the",
"emptiness of the landscape, a cry",
"arose whose shrillness pierced",
"the still air like a sharp arrow",
"flying straight to the very heart",
"of the land; and, as if by",
"enchantment, streams of human",
"beings—of naked human beings—with",
"spears in their hands, with bows,",
"with shields, with wild glances",
"and savage movements, were poured",
"into the clearing by the",
"dark-faced and pensive forest.",
"The bushes shook, the grass",
"swayed for a time, and then",
"everything stood still in",
"attentive immobility.",
"“'Now, if he does not say the",
"right thing to them we are all",
"done for,' said the Russian at my",
"elbow. The knot of men with the",
"stretcher had stopped, too,",
"halfway to the steamer, as if",
"petrified. I saw the man on the",
"stretcher sit up, lank and with",
"an uplifted arm, above the",
"shoulders of the bearers. 'Let us",
"hope that the man who can talk so",
"well of love in general will find",
"some particular reason to spare",
"us this time,' I said. I resented",
"bitterly the absurd danger of our",
"situation, as if to be at the",
"mercy of that atrocious phantom",
"had been a dishonouring",
"necessity. I could not hear a",
"sound, but through my glasses I",
"saw the thin arm extended",
"commandingly, the lower jaw",
"moving, the eyes of that",
"apparition shining darkly far in",
"its bony head that nodded with",
"grotesque jerks. Kurtz—Kurtz—that",
"means short in German—don't it?",
"Well, the name was as true as",
"everything else in his life—and",
"death. He looked at least seven",
"feet long. His covering had",
"fallen off, and his body emerged",
"from it pitiful and appalling as",
"from a winding-sheet. I could see",
"the cage of his ribs all astir,",
"the bones of his arm waving. It",
"was as though an animated image",
"of death carved out of old ivory",
"had been shaking its hand with",
"menaces at a motionless crowd of",
"men made of dark and glittering",
"bronze. I saw him open his mouth",
"wide—it gave him a weirdly",
"voracious aspect, as though he",
"had wanted to swallow all the",
"air, all the earth, all the men",
"before him. A deep voice reached",
"me faintly. He must have been",
"shouting. He fell back suddenly.",
"The stretcher shook as the",
"bearers staggered forward again,",
"and almost at the same time I",
"noticed that the crowd of savages",
"was vanishing without any",
"perceptible movement of retreat,",
"as if the forest that had ejected",
"these beings so suddenly had",
"drawn them in again as the breath",
"is drawn in a long aspiration.",
"“Some of the pilgrims behind the",
"stretcher carried his arms—two",
"shot-guns, a heavy rifle, and a",
"light revolver-carbine—the",
"thunderbolts of that pitiful",
"Jupiter. The manager bent over",
"him murmuring as he walked beside",
"his head. They laid him down in",
"one of the little cabins—just a",
"room for a bed place and a",
"camp-stool or two, you know. We",
"had brought his belated",
"correspondence, and a lot of torn",
"envelopes and open letters",
"littered his bed. His hand roamed",
"feebly amongst these papers. I",
"was struck by the fire of his",
"eyes and the composed languor of",
"his expression. It was not so",
"much the exhaustion of disease.",
"He did not seem in pain. This",
"shadow looked satiated and calm,",
"as though for the moment it had",
"had its fill of all the emotions.",
"“He rustled one of the letters,",
"and looking straight in my face",
"said, 'I am glad.' Somebody had",
"been writing to him about me.",
"These special recommendations",
"were turning up again. The volume",
"of tone he emitted without",
"effort, almost without the",
"trouble of moving his lips,",
"amazed me. A voice! a voice! It",
"was grave, profound, vibrating,",
"while the man did not seem",
"capable of a whisper. However, he",
"had enough strength in",
"him—factitious no doubt—to very",
"nearly make an end of us, as you",
"shall hear directly.",
"“The manager appeared silently in",
"the doorway; I stepped out at",
"once and he drew the curtain",
"after me. The Russian, eyed",
"curiously by the pilgrims, was",
"staring at the shore. I followed",
"the direction of his glance.",
"“Dark human shapes could be made",
"out in the distance, flitting",
"indistinctly against the gloomy",
"border of the forest, and near",
"the river two bronze figures,",
"leaning on tall spears, stood in",
"the sunlight under fantastic",
"head-dresses of spotted skins,",
"warlike and still in statuesque",
"repose. And from right to left",
"along the lighted shore moved a",
"wild and gorgeous apparition of a",
"woman.",
"“She walked with measured steps,",
"draped in striped and fringed",
"cloths, treading the earth",
"proudly, with a slight jingle and",
"flash of barbarous ornaments. She",
"carried her head high; her hair",
"was done in the shape of a",
"helmet; she had brass leggings to",
"the knee, brass wire gauntlets to",
"the elbow, a crimson spot on her",
"tawny cheek, innumerable",
"necklaces of glass beads on her",
"neck; bizarre things, charms,",
"gifts of witch-men, that hung",
"about her, glittered and trembled",
"at every step. She must have had",
"the value of several elephant",
"tusks upon her. She was savage",
"and superb, wild-eyed and",
"magnificent; there was something",
"ominous and stately in her",
"deliberate progress. And in the",
"hush that had fallen suddenly",
"upon the whole sorrowful land,",
"the immense wilderness, the",
"colossal body of the fecund and",
"mysterious life seemed to look at",
"her, pensive, as though it had",
"been looking at the image of its",
"own tenebrous and passionate",
"soul.",
"“She came abreast of the steamer,",
"stood still, and faced us. Her",
"long shadow fell to the water's",
"edge. Her face had a tragic and",
"fierce aspect of wild sorrow and",
"of dumb pain mingled with the",
"fear of some struggling,",
"half-shaped resolve. She stood",
"looking at us without a stir, and",
"like the wilderness itself, with",
"an air of brooding over an",
"inscrutable purpose. A whole",
"minute passed, and then she made",
"a step forward. There was a low",
"jingle, a glint of yellow metal,",
"a sway of fringed draperies, and",
"she stopped as if her heart had",
"failed her. The young fellow by",
"my side growled. The pilgrims",
"murmured at my back. She looked",
"at us all as if her life had",
"depended upon the unswerving",
"steadiness of her glance.",
"Suddenly she opened her bared",
"arms and threw them up rigid",
"above her head, as though in an",
"uncontrollable desire to touch",
"the sky, and at the same time the",
"swift shadows darted out on the",
"earth, swept around on the river,",
"gathering the steamer into a",
"shadowy embrace. A formidable",
"silence hung over the scene.",
"“She turned away slowly, walked",
"on, following the bank, and",
"passed into the bushes to the",
"left. Once only her eyes gleamed",
"back at us in the dusk of the",
"thickets before she disappeared.",
"“'If she had offered to come",
"aboard I really think I would",
"have tried to shoot her,' said",
"the man of patches, nervously. 'I",
"have been risking my life every",
"day for the last fortnight to",
"keep her out of the house. She",
"got in one day and kicked up a",
"row about those miserable rags I",
"picked up in the storeroom to",
"mend my clothes with. I wasn't",
"decent. At least it must have",
"been that, for she talked like a",
"fury to Kurtz for an hour,",
"pointing at me now and then. I",
"don't understand the dialect of",
"this tribe. Luckily for me, I",
"fancy Kurtz felt too ill that day",
"to care, or there would have been",
"mischief. I don't understand....",
"No—it's too much for me. Ah,",
"well, it's all over now.'",
"“At this moment I heard Kurtz's",
"deep voice behind the curtain:",
"'Save me!—save the ivory, you",
"mean. Don't tell me. Save me!",
"Why, I've had to save you. You",
"are interrupting my plans now.",
"Sick! Sick! Not so sick as you",
"would like to believe. Never",
"mind. I'll carry my ideas out",
"yet—I will return. I'll show you",
"what can be done. You with your",
"little peddling notions—you are",
"interfering with me. I will",
"return. I....'",
"“The manager came out. He did me",
"the honour to take me under the",
"arm and lead me aside. 'He is",
"very low, very low,' he said. He",
"considered it necessary to sigh,",
"but neglected to be consistently",
"sorrowful. 'We have done all we",
"could for him—haven't we? But",
"there is no disguising the fact,",
"Mr. Kurtz has done more harm than",
"good to the Company. He did not",
"see the time was not ripe for",
"vigorous action. Cautiously,",
"cautiously—that's my principle.",
"We must be cautious yet. The",
"district is closed to us for a",
"time. Deplorable! Upon the whole,",
"the trade will suffer. I don't",
"deny there is a remarkable",
"quantity of ivory—mostly fossil.",
"We must save it, at all",
"events—but look how precarious",
"the position is—and why? Because",
"the method is unsound.' 'Do you,'",
"said I, looking at the shore,",
"'call it “unsound method?”'",
"'Without doubt,' he exclaimed",
"hotly. 'Don't you?'... 'No method",
"at all,' I murmured after a",
"while. 'Exactly,' he exulted. 'I",
"anticipated this. Shows a",
"complete want of judgment. It is",
"my duty to point it out in the",
"proper quarter.' 'Oh,' said I,",
"'that fellow—what's his name?—the",
"brickmaker, will make a readable",
"report for you.' He appeared",
"confounded for a moment. It",
"seemed to me I had never breathed",
"an atmosphere so vile, and I",
"turned mentally to Kurtz for",
"relief—positively for relief.",
"'Nevertheless I think Mr. Kurtz",
"is a remarkable man,' I said with",
"emphasis. He started, dropped on",
"me a heavy glance, said very",
"quietly, 'he was,' and turned his",
"back on me. My hour of favour was",
"over; I found myself lumped along",
"with Kurtz as a partisan of",
"methods for which the time was",
"not ripe: I was unsound! Ah! but",
"it was something to have at least",
"a choice of nightmares.",
"“I had turned to the wilderness",
"really, not to Mr. Kurtz, who, I",
"was ready to admit, was as good",
"as buried. And for a moment it",
"seemed to me as if I also were",
"buried in a vast grave full of",
"unspeakable secrets. I felt an",
"intolerable weight oppressing my",
"breast, the smell of the damp",
"earth, the unseen presence of",
"victorious corruption, the",
"darkness of an impenetrable",
"night.... The Russian tapped me",
"on the shoulder. I heard him",
"mumbling and stammering something",
"about 'brother seaman—couldn't",
"conceal—knowledge of matters that",
"would affect Mr. Kurtz's",
"reputation.' I waited. For him",
"evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in",
"his grave; I suspect that for him",
"Mr. Kurtz was one of the",
"immortals. 'Well!' said I at",
"last, 'speak out. As it happens,",
"I am Mr. Kurtz's friend—in a",
"way.'",
"“He stated with a good deal of",
"formality that had we not been",
"'of the same profession,' he",
"would have kept the matter to",
"himself without regard to",
"consequences. 'He suspected there",
"was an active ill-will towards",
"him on the part of these white",
"men that—' 'You are right,' I",
"said, remembering a certain",
"conversation I had overheard.",
"'The manager thinks you ought to",
"be hanged.' He showed a concern",
"at this intelligence which amused",
"me at first. 'I had better get",
"out of the way quietly,' he said",
"earnestly. 'I can do no more for",
"Kurtz now, and they would soon",
"find some excuse. What's to stop",
"them? There's a military post",
"three hundred miles from here.'",
"'Well, upon my word,' said I,",
"'perhaps you had better go if you",
"have any friends amongst the",
"savages near by.' 'Plenty,' he",
"said. 'They are simple people—and",
"I want nothing, you know.' He",
"stood biting his lip, then: 'I",
"don't want any harm to happen to",
"these whites here, but of course",
"I was thinking of Mr. Kurtz's",
"reputation—but you are a brother",
"seaman and—' 'All right,' said I,",
"after a time. 'Mr. Kurtz's",
"reputation is safe with me.' I",
"did not know how truly I spoke.",
"“He informed me, lowering his",
"voice, that it was Kurtz who had",
"ordered the attack to be made on",
"the steamer. 'He hated sometimes",
"the idea of being taken away—and",
"then again.... But I don't",
"understand these matters. I am a",
"simple man. He thought it would",
"scare you away—that you would",
"give it up, thinking him dead. I",
"could not stop him. Oh, I had an",
"awful time of it this last",
"month.' 'Very well,' I said. 'He",
"is all right now.' 'Ye-e-es,' he",
"muttered, not very convinced",
"apparently. 'Thanks,' said I; 'I",
"shall keep my eyes open.' 'But",
"quiet-eh?' he urged anxiously.",
"'It would be awful for his",
"reputation if anybody here—' I",
"promised a complete discretion",
"with great gravity. 'I have a",
"canoe and three black fellows",
"waiting not very far. I am off.",
"Could you give me a few",
"Martini-Henry cartridges?' I",
"could, and did, with proper",
"secrecy. He helped himself, with",
"a wink at me, to a handful of my",
"tobacco. 'Between sailors—you",
"know—good English tobacco.' At",
"the door of the pilot-house he",
"turned round—'I say, haven't you",
"a pair of shoes you could spare?'",
"He raised one leg. 'Look.' The",
"soles were tied with knotted",
"strings sandalwise under his bare",
"feet. I rooted out an old pair,",
"at which he looked with",
"admiration before tucking it",
"under his left arm. One of his",
"pockets (bright red) was bulging",
"with cartridges, from the other",
"(dark blue) peeped 'Towson's",
"Inquiry,' etc., etc. He seemed to",
"think himself excellently well",
"equipped for a renewed encounter",
"with the wilderness. 'Ah! I'll",
"never, never meet such a man",
"again. You ought to have heard",
"him recite poetry—his own, too,",
"it was, he told me. Poetry!' He",
"rolled his eyes at the",
"recollection of these delights.",
"'Oh, he enlarged my mind!'",
"'Good-bye,' said I. He shook",
"hands and vanished in the night.",
"Sometimes I ask myself whether I",
"had ever really seen him—whether",
"it was possible to meet such a",
"phenomenon!...",
"“When I woke up shortly after",
"midnight his warning came to my",
"mind with its hint of danger that",
"seemed, in the starred darkness,",
"real enough to make me get up for",
"the purpose of having a look",
"round. On the hill a big fire",
"burned, illuminating fitfully a",
"crooked corner of the",
"station-house. One of the agents",
"with a picket of a few of our",
"blacks, armed for the purpose,",
"was keeping guard over the ivory;",
"but deep within the forest, red",
"gleams that wavered, that seemed",
"to sink and rise from the ground",
"amongst confused columnar shapes",
"of intense blackness, showed the",
"exact position of the camp where",
"Mr. Kurtz's adorers were keeping",
"their uneasy vigil. The",
"monotonous beating of a big drum",
"filled the air with muffled",
"shocks and a lingering vibration.",
"A steady droning sound of many",
"men chanting each to himself some",
"weird incantation came out from",
"the black, flat wall of the woods",
"as the humming of bees comes out",
"of a hive, and had a strange",
"narcotic effect upon my",
"half-awake senses. I believe I",
"dozed off leaning over the rail,",
"till an abrupt burst of yells, an",
"overwhelming outbreak of a",
"pent-up and mysterious frenzy,",
"woke me up in a bewildered",
"wonder. It was cut short all at",
"once, and the low droning went on",
"with an effect of audible and",
"soothing silence. I glanced",
"casually into the little cabin. A",
"light was burning within, but Mr.",
"Kurtz was not there.",
"“I think I would have raised an",
"outcry if I had believed my eyes.",
"But I didn't believe them at",
"first—the thing seemed so",
"impossible. The fact is I was",
"completely unnerved by a sheer",
"blank fright, pure abstract",
"terror, unconnected with any",
"distinct shape of physical",
"danger. What made this emotion so",
"overpowering was—how shall I",
"define it?—the moral shock I",
"received, as if something",
"altogether monstrous, intolerable",
"to thought and odious to the",
"soul, had been thrust upon me",
"unexpectedly. This lasted of",
"course the merest fraction of a",
"second, and then the usual sense",
"of commonplace, deadly danger,",
"the possibility of a sudden",
"onslaught and massacre, or",
"something of the kind, which I",
"saw impending, was positively",
"welcome and composing. It",
"pacified me, in fact, so much",
"that I did not raise an alarm.",
"“There was an agent buttoned up",
"inside an ulster and sleeping on",
"a chair on deck within three feet",
"of me. The yells had not awakened",
"him; he snored very slightly; I",
"left him to his slumbers and",
"leaped ashore. I did not betray",
"Mr. Kurtz—it was ordered I should",
"never betray him—it was written I",
"should be loyal to the nightmare",
"of my choice. I was anxious to",
"deal with this shadow by myself",
"alone—and to this day I don't",
"know why I was so jealous of",
"sharing with any one the peculiar",
"blackness of that experience.",
"“As soon as I got on the bank I",
"saw a trail—a broad trail through",
"the grass. I remember the",
"exultation with which I said to",
"myself, 'He can't walk—he is",
"crawling on all-fours—I've got",
"him.' The grass was wet with dew.",
"I strode rapidly with clenched",
"fists. I fancy I had some vague",
"notion of falling upon him and",
"giving him a drubbing. I don't",
"know. I had some imbecile",
"thoughts. The knitting old woman",
"with the cat obtruded herself",
"upon my memory as a most improper",
"person to be sitting at the other",
"end of such an affair. I saw a",
"row of pilgrims squirting lead in",
"the air out of Winchesters held",
"to the hip. I thought I would",
"never get back to the steamer,",
"and imagined myself living alone",
"and unarmed in the woods to an",
"advanced age. Such silly",
"things—you know. And I remember I",
"confounded the beat of the drum",
"with the beating of my heart, and",
"was pleased at its calm",
"regularity.",
"“I kept to the track though—then",
"stopped to listen. The night was",
"very clear; a dark blue space,",
"sparkling with dew and starlight,",
"in which black things stood very",
"still. I thought I could see a",
"kind of motion ahead of me. I was",
"strangely cocksure of everything",
"that night. I actually left the",
"track and ran in a wide",
"semicircle (I verily believe",
"chuckling to myself) so as to get",
"in front of that stir, of that",
"motion I had seen—if indeed I had",
"seen anything. I was",
"circumventing Kurtz as though it",
"had been a boyish game.",
"“I came upon him, and, if he had",
"not heard me coming, I would have",
"fallen over him, too, but he got",
"up in time. He rose, unsteady,",
"long, pale, indistinct, like a",
"vapour exhaled by the earth, and",
"swayed slightly, misty and silent",
"before me; while at my back the",
"fires loomed between the trees,",
"and the murmur of many voices",
"issued from the forest. I had cut",
"him off cleverly; but when",
"actually confronting him I seemed",
"to come to my senses, I saw the",
"danger in its right proportion.",
"It was by no means over yet.",
"Suppose he began to shout? Though",
"he could hardly stand, there was",
"still plenty of vigour in his",
"voice. 'Go away—hide yourself,'",
"he said, in that profound tone.",
"It was very awful. I glanced",
"back. We were within thirty yards",
"from the nearest fire. A black",
"figure stood up, strode on long",
"black legs, waving long black",
"arms, across the glow. It had",
"horns—antelope horns, I think—on",
"its head. Some sorcerer, some",
"witch-man, no doubt: it looked",
"fiendlike enough. 'Do you know",
"what you are doing?' I whispered.",
"'Perfectly,' he answered, raising",
"his voice for that single word:",
"it sounded to me far off and yet",
"loud, like a hail through a",
"speaking-trumpet. 'If he makes a",
"row we are lost,' I thought to",
"myself. This clearly was not a",
"case for fisticuffs, even apart",
"from the very natural aversion I",
"had to beat that Shadow—this",
"wandering and tormented thing.",
"'You will be lost,' I",
"said—'utterly lost.' One gets",
"sometimes such a flash of",
"inspiration, you know. I did say",
"the right thing, though indeed he",
"could not have been more",
"irretrievably lost than he was at",
"this very moment, when the",
"foundations of our intimacy were",
"being laid—to endure—to",
"endure—even to the end—even",
"beyond.",
"“'I had immense plans,' he",
"muttered irresolutely. 'Yes,'",
"said I; 'but if you try to shout",
"I'll smash your head with—' There",
"was not a stick or a stone near.",
"'I will throttle you for good,' I",
"corrected myself. 'I was on the",
"threshold of great things,' he",
"pleaded, in a voice of longing,",
"with a wistfulness of tone that",
"made my blood run cold. 'And now",
"for this stupid scoundrel—' 'Your",
"success in Europe is assured in",
"any case,' I affirmed steadily. I",
"did not want to have the",
"throttling of him, you",
"understand—and indeed it would",
"have been very little use for any",
"practical purpose. I tried to",
"break the spell—the heavy, mute",
"spell of the wilderness—that",
"seemed to draw him to its",
"pitiless breast by the awakening",
"of forgotten and brutal",
"instincts, by the memory of",
"gratified and monstrous passions.",
"This alone, I was convinced, had",
"driven him out to the edge of the",
"forest, to the bush, towards the",
"gleam of fires, the throb of",
"drums, the drone of weird",
"incantations; this alone had",
"beguiled his unlawful soul beyond",
"the bounds of permitted",
"aspirations. And, don't you see,",
"the terror of the position was",
"not in being knocked on the",
"head—though I had a very lively",
"sense of that danger, too—but in",
"this, that I had to deal with a",
"being to whom I could not appeal",
"in the name of anything high or",
"low. I had, even like the",
"niggers, to invoke",
"him—himself—his own exalted and",
"incredible degradation. There was",
"nothing either above or below",
"him, and I knew it. He had kicked",
"himself loose of the earth.",
"Confound the man! he had kicked",
"the very earth to pieces. He was",
"alone, and I before him did not",
"know whether I stood on the",
"ground or floated in the air.",
"I've been telling you what we",
"said—repeating the phrases we",
"pronounced—but what's the good?",
"They were common everyday",
"words—the familiar, vague sounds",
"exchanged on every waking day of",
"life. But what of that? They had",
"behind them, to my mind, the",
"terrific suggestiveness of words",
"heard in dreams, of phrases",
"spoken in nightmares. Soul! If",
"anybody ever struggled with a",
"soul, I am the man. And I wasn't",
"arguing with a lunatic either.",
"Believe me or not, his",
"intelligence was perfectly",
"clear—concentrated, it is true,",
"upon himself with horrible",
"intensity, yet clear; and therein",
"was my only chance—barring, of",
"course, the killing him there and",
"then, which wasn't so good, on",
"account of unavoidable noise. But",
"his soul was mad. Being alone in",
"the wilderness, it had looked",
"within itself, and, by heavens! I",
"tell you, it had gone mad. I",
"had—for my sins, I suppose—to go",
"through the ordeal of looking",
"into it myself. No eloquence",
"could have been so withering to",
"one's belief in mankind as his",
"final burst of sincerity. He",
"struggled with himself, too. I",
"saw it—I heard it. I saw the",
"inconceivable mystery of a soul",
"that knew no restraint, no faith,",
"and no fear, yet struggling",
"blindly with itself. I kept my",
"head pretty well; but when I had",
"him at last stretched on the",
"couch, I wiped my forehead, while",
"my legs shook under me as though",
"I had carried half a ton on my",
"back down that hill. And yet I",
"had only supported him, his bony",
"arm clasped round my neck—and he",
"was not much heavier than a",
"child.",
"“When next day we left at noon,",
"the crowd, of whose presence",
"behind the curtain of trees I had",
"been acutely conscious all the",
"time, flowed out of the woods",
"again, filled the clearing,",
"covered the slope with a mass of",
"naked, breathing, quivering,",
"bronze bodies. I steamed up a",
"bit, then swung down stream, and",
"two thousand eyes followed the",
"evolutions of the splashing,",
"thumping, fierce river-demon",
"beating the water with its",
"terrible tail and breathing black",
"smoke into the air. In front of",
"the first rank, along the river,",
"three men, plastered with bright",
"red earth from head to foot,",
"strutted to and fro restlessly.",
"When we came abreast again, they",
"faced the river, stamped their",
"feet, nodded their horned heads,",
"swayed their scarlet bodies; they",
"shook towards the fierce",
"river-demon a bunch of black",
"feathers, a mangy skin with a",
"pendent tail—something that",
"looked a dried gourd; they",
"shouted periodically together",
"strings of amazing words that",
"resembled no sounds of human",
"language; and the deep murmurs of",
"the crowd, interrupted suddenly,",
"were like the responses of some",
"satanic litany.",
"“We had carried Kurtz into the",
"pilot-house: there was more air",
"there. Lying on the couch, he",
"stared through the open shutter.",
"There was an eddy in the mass of",
"human bodies, and the woman with",
"helmeted head and tawny cheeks",
"rushed out to the very brink of",
"the stream. She put out her",
"hands, shouted something, and all",
"that wild mob took up the shout",
"in a roaring chorus of",
"articulated, rapid, breathless",
"utterance.",
"“'Do you understand this?' I",
"asked.",
"“He kept on looking out past me",
"with fiery, longing eyes, with a",
"mingled expression of wistfulness",
"and hate. He made no answer, but",
"I saw a smile, a smile of",
"indefinable meaning, appear on",
"his colourless lips that a moment",
"after twitched convulsively. 'Do",
"I not?' he said slowly, gasping,",
"as if the words had been torn out",
"of him by a supernatural power.",
"“I pulled the string of the",
"whistle, and I did this because I",
"saw the pilgrims on deck getting",
"out their rifles with an air of",
"anticipating a jolly lark. At the",
"sudden screech there was a",
"movement of abject terror through",
"that wedged mass of bodies.",
"'Don't! don't you frighten them",
"away,' cried some one on deck",
"disconsolately. I pulled the",
"string time after time. They",
"broke and ran, they leaped, they",
"crouched, they swerved, they",
"dodged the flying terror of the",
"sound. The three red chaps had",
"fallen flat, face down on the",
"shore, as though they had been",
"shot dead. Only the barbarous and",
"superb woman did not so much as",
"flinch, and stretched tragically",
"her bare arms after us over the",
"sombre and glittering river.",
"“And then that imbecile crowd",
"down on the deck started their",
"little fun, and I could see",
"nothing more for smoke.",
"“The brown current ran swiftly",
"out of the heart of darkness,",
"bearing us down towards the sea",
"with twice the speed of our",
"upward progress; and Kurtz's life",
"was running swiftly, too, ebbing,",
"ebbing out of his heart into the",
"sea of inexorable time. The",
"manager was very placid, he had",
"no vital anxieties now, he took",
"us both in with a comprehensive",
"and satisfied glance: the",
"'affair' had come off as well as",
"could be wished. I saw the time",
"approaching when I would be left",
"alone of the party of 'unsound",
"method.' The pilgrims looked upon",
"me with disfavour. I was, so to",
"speak, numbered with the dead. It",
"is strange how I accepted this",
"unforeseen partnership, this",
"choice of nightmares forced upon",
"me in the tenebrous land invaded",
"by these mean and greedy",
"phantoms.",
"“Kurtz discoursed. A voice! a",
"voice! It rang deep to the very",
"last. It survived his strength to",
"hide in the magnificent folds of",
"eloquence the barren darkness of",
"his heart. Oh, he struggled! he",
"struggled! The wastes of his",
"weary brain were haunted by",
"shadowy images now—images of",
"wealth and fame revolving",
"obsequiously round his",
"unextinguishable gift of noble",
"and lofty expression. My",
"Intended, my station, my career,",
"my ideas—these were the subjects",
"for the occasional utterances of",
"elevated sentiments. The shade of",
"the original Kurtz frequented the",
"bedside of the hollow sham, whose",
"fate it was to be buried",
"presently in the mould of",
"primeval earth. But both the",
"diabolic love and the unearthly",
"hate of the mysteries it had",
"penetrated fought for the",
"possession of that soul satiated",
"with primitive emotions, avid of",
"lying fame, of sham distinction,",
"of all the appearances of success",
"and power.",
"“Sometimes he was contemptibly",
"childish. He desired to have",
"kings meet him at",
"railway-stations on his return",
"from some ghastly Nowhere, where",
"he intended to accomplish great",
"things. 'You show them you have",
"in you something that is really",
"profitable, and then there will",
"be no limits to the recognition",
"of your ability,' he would say.",
"'Of course you must take care of",
"the motives—right",
"motives—always.' The long reaches",
"that were like one and the same",
"reach, monotonous bends that were",
"exactly alike, slipped past the",
"steamer with their multitude of",
"secular trees looking patiently",
"after this grimy fragment of",
"another world, the forerunner of",
"change, of conquest, of trade, of",
"massacres, of blessings. I looked",
"ahead—piloting. 'Close the",
"shutter,' said Kurtz suddenly one",
"day; 'I can't bear to look at",
"this.' I did so. There was a",
"silence. 'Oh, but I will wring",
"your heart yet!' he cried at the",
"invisible wilderness.",
"“We broke down—as I had",
"expected—and had to lie up for",
"repairs at the head of an island.",
"This delay was the first thing",
"that shook Kurtz's confidence.",
"One morning he gave me a packet",
"of papers and a photograph—the",
"lot tied together with a",
"shoe-string. 'Keep this for me,'",
"he said. 'This noxious fool'",
"(meaning the manager) 'is capable",
"of prying into my boxes when I am",
"not looking.' In the afternoon I",
"saw him. He was lying on his back",
"with closed eyes, and I withdrew",
"quietly, but I heard him mutter,",
"'Live rightly, die, die...' I",
"listened. There was nothing more.",
"Was he rehearsing some speech in",
"his sleep, or was it a fragment",
"of a phrase from some newspaper",
"article? He had been writing for",
"the papers and meant to do so",
"again, 'for the furthering of my",
"ideas. It's a duty.'",
"“His was an impenetrable",
"darkness. I looked at him as you",
"peer down at a man who is lying",
"at the bottom of a precipice",
"where the sun never shines. But I",
"had not much time to give him,",
"because I was helping the",
"engine-driver to take to pieces",
"the leaky cylinders, to",
"straighten a bent connecting-rod,",
"and in other such matters. I",
"lived in an infernal mess of",
"rust, filings, nuts, bolts,",
"spanners, hammers,",
"ratchet-drills—things I",
"abominate, because I don't get on",
"with them. I tended the little",
"forge we fortunately had aboard;",
"I toiled wearily in a wretched",
"scrap-heap—unless I had the",
"shakes too bad to stand.",
"“One evening coming in with a",
"candle I was startled to hear him",
"say a little tremulously, 'I am",
"lying here in the dark waiting",
"for death.' The light was within",
"a foot of his eyes. I forced",
"myself to murmur, 'Oh, nonsense!'",
"and stood over him as if",
"transfixed.",
"“Anything approaching the change",
"that came over his features I",
"have never seen before, and hope",
"never to see again. Oh, I wasn't",
"touched. I was fascinated. It was",
"as though a veil had been rent. I",
"saw on that ivory face the",
"expression of sombre pride, of",
"ruthless power, of craven",
"terror—of an intense and hopeless",
"despair. Did he live his life",
"again in every detail of desire,",
"temptation, and surrender during",
"that supreme moment of complete",
"knowledge? He cried in a whisper",
"at some image, at some vision—he",
"cried out twice, a cry that was",
"no more than a breath:",
"“'The horror! The horror!'",
"“I blew the candle out and left",
"the cabin. The pilgrims were",
"dining in the mess-room, and I",
"took my place opposite the",
"manager, who lifted his eyes to",
"give me a questioning glance,",
"which I successfully ignored. He",
"leaned back, serene, with that",
"peculiar smile of his sealing the",
"unexpressed depths of his",
"meanness. A continuous shower of",
"small flies streamed upon the",
"lamp, upon the cloth, upon our",
"hands and faces. Suddenly the",
"manager's boy put his insolent",
"black head in the doorway, and",
"said in a tone of scathing",
"contempt:",
"“'Mistah Kurtz—he dead.'",
"“All the pilgrims rushed out to",
"see. I remained, and went on with",
"my dinner. I believe I was",
"considered brutally callous.",
"However, I did not eat much.",
"There was a lamp in there—light,",
"don't you know—and outside it was",
"so beastly, beastly dark. I went",
"no more near the remarkable man",
"who had pronounced a judgment",
"upon the adventures of his soul",
"on this earth. The voice was",
"gone. What else had been there?",
"But I am of course aware that",
"next day the pilgrims buried",
"something in a muddy hole.",
"“And then they very nearly buried",
"me.",
"“However, as you see, I did not",
"go to join Kurtz there and then.",
"I did not. I remained to dream",
"the nightmare out to the end, and",
"to show my loyalty to Kurtz once",
"more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll",
"thing life is—that mysterious",
"arrangement of merciless logic",
"for a futile purpose. The most",
"you can hope from it is some",
"knowledge of yourself—that comes",
"too late—a crop of",
"unextinguishable regrets. I have",
"wrestled with death. It is the",
"most unexciting contest you can",
"imagine. It takes place in an",
"impalpable greyness, with nothing",
"underfoot, with nothing around,",
"without spectators, without",
"clamour, without glory, without",
"the great desire of victory,",
"without the great fear of defeat,",
"in a sickly atmosphere of tepid",
"scepticism, without much belief",
"in your own right, and still less",
"in that of your adversary. If",
"such is the form of ultimate",
"wisdom, then life is a greater",
"riddle than some of us think it",
"to be. I was within a hair's",
"breadth of the last opportunity",
"for pronouncement, and I found",
"with humiliation that probably I",
"would have nothing to say. This",
"is the reason why I affirm that",
"Kurtz was a remarkable man. He",
"had something to say. He said it.",
"Since I had peeped over the edge",
"myself, I understand better the",
"meaning of his stare, that could",
"not see the flame of the candle,",
"but was wide enough to embrace",
"the whole universe, piercing",
"enough to penetrate all the",
"hearts that beat in the darkness.",
"He had summed up—he had judged.",
"'The horror!' He was a remarkable",
"man. After all, this was the",
"expression of some sort of",
"belief; it had candour, it had",
"conviction, it had a vibrating",
"note of revolt in its whisper, it",
"had the appalling face of a",
"glimpsed truth—the strange",
"commingling of desire and hate.",
"And it is not my own extremity I",
"remember best—a vision of",
"greyness without form filled with",
"physical pain, and a careless",
"contempt for the evanescence of",
"all things—even of this pain",
"itself. No! It is his extremity",
"that I seem to have lived",
"through. True, he had made that",
"last stride, he had stepped over",
"the edge, while I had been",
"permitted to draw back my",
"hesitating foot. And perhaps in",
"this is the whole difference;",
"perhaps all the wisdom, and all",
"truth, and all sincerity, are",
"just compressed into that",
"inappreciable moment of time in",
"which we step over the threshold",
"of the invisible. Perhaps! I like",
"to think my summing-up would not",
"have been a word of careless",
"contempt. Better his cry—much",
"better. It was an affirmation, a",
"moral victory paid for by",
"innumerable defeats, by",
"abominable terrors, by abominable",
"satisfactions. But it was a",
"victory! That is why I have",
"remained loyal to Kurtz to the",
"last, and even beyond, when a",
"long time after I heard once",
"more, not his own voice, but the",
"echo of his magnificent eloquence",
"thrown to me from a soul as",
"translucently pure as a cliff of",
"crystal.",
"“No, they did not bury me, though",
"there is a period of time which I",
"remember mistily, with a",
"shuddering wonder, like a passage",
"through some inconceivable world",
"that had no hope in it and no",
"desire. I found myself back in",
"the sepulchral city resenting the",
"sight of people hurrying through",
"the streets to filch a little",
"money from each other, to devour",
"their infamous cookery, to gulp",
"their unwholesome beer, to dream",
"their insignificant and silly",
"dreams. They trespassed upon my",
"thoughts. They were intruders",
"whose knowledge of life was to me",
"an irritating pretence, because I",
"felt so sure they could not",
"possibly know the things I knew.",
"Their bearing, which was simply",
"the bearing of commonplace",
"individuals going about their",
"business in the assurance of",
"perfect safety, was offensive to",
"me like the outrageous flauntings",
"of folly in the face of a danger",
"it is unable to comprehend. I had",
"no particular desire to enlighten",
"them, but I had some difficulty",
"in restraining myself from",
"laughing in their faces so full",
"of stupid importance. I daresay I",
"was not very well at that time. I",
"tottered about the streets—there",
"were various affairs to",
"settle—grinning bitterly at",
"perfectly respectable persons. I",
"admit my behaviour was",
"inexcusable, but then my",
"temperature was seldom normal in",
"these days. My dear aunt's",
"endeavours to 'nurse up my",
"strength' seemed altogether",
"beside the mark. It was not my",
"strength that wanted nursing, it",
"was my imagination that wanted",
"soothing. I kept the bundle of",
"papers given me by Kurtz, not",
"knowing exactly what to do with",
"it. His mother had died lately,",
"watched over, as I was told, by",
"his Intended. A clean-shaved man,",
"with an official manner and",
"wearing gold-rimmed spectacles,",
"called on me one day and made",
"inquiries, at first circuitous,",
"afterwards suavely pressing,",
"about what he was pleased to",
"denominate certain 'documents.' I",
"was not surprised, because I had",
"had two rows with the manager on",
"the subject out there. I had",
"refused to give up the smallest",
"scrap out of that package, and I",
"took the same attitude with the",
"spectacled man. He became darkly",
"menacing at last, and with much",
"heat argued that the Company had",
"the right to every bit of",
"information about its",
"'territories.' And said he, 'Mr.",
"Kurtz's knowledge of unexplored",
"regions must have been",
"necessarily extensive and",
"peculiar—owing to his great",
"abilities and to the deplorable",
"circumstances in which he had",
"been placed: therefore—' I",
"assured him Mr. Kurtz's",
"knowledge, however extensive, did",
"not bear upon the problems of",
"commerce or administration. He",
"invoked then the name of science.",
"'It would be an incalculable loss",
"if,' etc., etc. I offered him the",
"report on the 'Suppression of",
"Savage Customs,' with the",
"postscriptum torn off. He took it",
"up eagerly, but ended by sniffing",
"at it with an air of contempt.",
"'This is not what we had a right",
"to expect,' he remarked. 'Expect",
"nothing else,' I said. 'There are",
"only private letters.' He",
"withdrew upon some threat of",
"legal proceedings, and I saw him",
"no more; but another fellow,",
"calling himself Kurtz's cousin,",
"appeared two days later, and was",
"anxious to hear all the details",
"about his dear relative's last",
"moments. Incidentally he gave me",
"to understand that Kurtz had been",
"essentially a great musician.",
"'There was the making of an",
"immense success,' said the man,",
"who was an organist, I believe,",
"with lank grey hair flowing over",
"a greasy coat-collar. I had no",
"reason to doubt his statement;",
"and to this day I am unable to",
"say what was Kurtz's profession,",
"whether he ever had any—which was",
"the greatest of his talents. I",
"had taken him for a painter who",
"wrote for the papers, or else for",
"a journalist who could paint—but",
"even the cousin (who took snuff",
"during the interview) could not",
"tell me what he had been—exactly.",
"He was a universal genius—on that",
"point I agreed with the old chap,",
"who thereupon blew his nose",
"noisily into a large cotton",
"handkerchief and withdrew in",
"senile agitation, bearing off",
"some family letters and memoranda",
"without importance. Ultimately a",
"journalist anxious to know",
"something of the fate of his",
"'dear colleague' turned up. This",
"visitor informed me Kurtz's",
"proper sphere ought to have been",
"politics 'on the popular side.'",
"He had furry straight eyebrows,",
"bristly hair cropped short, an",
"eyeglass on a broad ribbon, and,",
"becoming expansive, confessed his",
"opinion that Kurtz really",
"couldn't write a bit—'but",
"heavens! how that man could talk.",
"He electrified large meetings. He",
"had faith—don't you see?—he had",
"the faith. He could get himself",
"to believe anything—anything. He",
"would have been a splendid leader",
"of an extreme party.' 'What",
"party?' I asked. 'Any party,'",
"answered the other. 'He was",
"an—an—extremist.' Did I not think",
"so? I assented. Did I know, he",
"asked, with a sudden flash of",
"curiosity, 'what it was that had",
"induced him to go out there?'",
"'Yes,' said I, and forthwith",
"handed him the famous Report for",
"publication, if he thought fit.",
"He glanced through it hurriedly,",
"mumbling all the time, judged 'it",
"would do,' and took himself off",
"with this plunder.",
"“Thus I was left at last with a",
"slim packet of letters and the",
"girl's portrait. She struck me as",
"beautiful—I mean she had a",
"beautiful expression. I know that",
"the sunlight can be made to lie,",
"too, yet one felt that no",
"manipulation of light and pose",
"could have conveyed the delicate",
"shade of truthfulness upon those",
"features. She seemed ready to",
"listen without mental",
"reservation, without suspicion,",
"without a thought for herself. I",
"concluded I would go and give her",
"back her portrait and those",
"letters myself. Curiosity? Yes;",
"and also some other feeling",
"perhaps. All that had been",
"Kurtz's had passed out of my",
"hands: his soul, his body, his",
"station, his plans, his ivory,",
"his career. There remained only",
"his memory and his Intended—and I",
"wanted to give that up, too, to",
"the past, in a way—to surrender",
"personally all that remained of",
"him with me to that oblivion",
"which is the last word of our",
"common fate. I don't defend",
"myself. I had no clear perception",
"of what it was I really wanted.",
"Perhaps it was an impulse of",
"unconscious loyalty, or the",
"fulfilment of one of those ironic",
"necessities that lurk in the",
"facts of human existence. I don't",
"know. I can't tell. But I went.",
"“I thought his memory was like",
"the other memories of the dead",
"that accumulate in every man's",
"life—a vague impress on the brain",
"of shadows that had fallen on it",
"in their swift and final passage;",
"but before the high and ponderous",
"door, between the tall houses of",
"a street as still and decorous as",
"a well-kept alley in a cemetery,",
"I had a vision of him on the",
"stretcher, opening his mouth",
"voraciously, as if to devour all",
"the earth with all its mankind.",
"He lived then before me; he lived",
"as much as he had ever lived—a",
"shadow insatiable of splendid",
"appearances, of frightful",
"realities; a shadow darker than",
"the shadow of the night, and",
"draped nobly in the folds of a",
"gorgeous eloquence. The vision",
"seemed to enter the house with",
"me—the stretcher, the",
"phantom-bearers, the wild crowd",
"of obedient worshippers, the",
"gloom of the forests, the glitter",
"of the reach between the murky",
"bends, the beat of the drum,",
"regular and muffled like the",
"beating of a heart—the heart of a",
"conquering darkness. It was a",
"moment of triumph for the",
"wilderness, an invading and",
"vengeful rush which, it seemed to",
"me, I would have to keep back",
"alone for the salvation of",
"another soul. And the memory of",
"what I had heard him say afar",
"there, with the horned shapes",
"stirring at my back, in the glow",
"of fires, within the patient",
"woods, those broken phrases came",
"back to me, were heard again in",
"their ominous and terrifying",
"simplicity. I remembered his",
"abject pleading, his abject",
"threats, the colossal scale of",
"his vile desires, the meanness,",
"the torment, the tempestuous",
"anguish of his soul. And later on",
"I seemed to see his collected",
"languid manner, when he said one",
"day, 'This lot of ivory now is",
"really mine. The Company did not",
"pay for it. I collected it myself",
"at a very great personal risk. I",
"am afraid they will try to claim",
"it as theirs though. H'm. It is a",
"difficult case. What do you think",
"I ought to do—resist? Eh? I want",
"no more than justice.'... He",
"wanted no more than justice—no",
"more than justice. I rang the",
"bell before a mahogany door on",
"the first floor, and while I",
"waited he seemed to stare at me",
"out of the glassy panel—stare",
"with that wide and immense stare",
"embracing, condemning, loathing",
"all the universe. I seemed to",
"hear the whispered cry, “The",
"horror! The horror!”",
"“The dusk was falling. I had to",
"wait in a lofty drawing-room with",
"three long windows from floor to",
"ceiling that were like three",
"luminous and bedraped columns.",
"The bent gilt legs and backs of",
"the furniture shone in indistinct",
"curves. The tall marble fireplace",
"had a cold and monumental",
"whiteness. A grand piano stood",
"massively in a corner; with dark",
"gleams on the flat surfaces like",
"a sombre and polished",
"sarcophagus. A high door",
"opened—closed. I rose.",
"“She came forward, all in black,",
"with a pale head, floating",
"towards me in the dusk. She was",
"in mourning. It was more than a",
"year since his death, more than a",
"year since the news came; she",
"seemed as though she would",
"remember and mourn forever. She",
"took both my hands in hers and",
"murmured, 'I had heard you were",
"coming.' I noticed she was not",
"very young—I mean not girlish.",
"She had a mature capacity for",
"fidelity, for belief, for",
"suffering. The room seemed to",
"have grown darker, as if all the",
"sad light of the cloudy evening",
"had taken refuge on her forehead.",
"This fair hair, this pale visage,",
"this pure brow, seemed surrounded",
"by an ashy halo from which the",
"dark eyes looked out at me. Their",
"glance was guileless, profound,",
"confident, and trustful. She",
"carried her sorrowful head as",
"though she were proud of that",
"sorrow, as though she would say,",
"'I—I alone know how to mourn for",
"him as he deserves.' But while we",
"were still shaking hands, such a",
"look of awful desolation came",
"upon her face that I perceived",
"she was one of those creatures",
"that are not the playthings of",
"Time. For her he had died only",
"yesterday. And, by Jove! the",
"impression was so powerful that",
"for me, too, he seemed to have",
"died only yesterday—nay, this",
"very minute. I saw her and him in",
"the same instant of time—his",
"death and her sorrow—I saw her",
"sorrow in the very moment of his",
"death. Do you understand? I saw",
"them together—I heard them",
"together. She had said, with a",
"deep catch of the breath, 'I have",
"survived' while my strained ears",
"seemed to hear distinctly,",
"mingled with her tone of",
"despairing regret, the summing up",
"whisper of his eternal",
"condemnation. I asked myself what",
"I was doing there, with a",
"sensation of panic in my heart as",
"though I had blundered into a",
"place of cruel and absurd",
"mysteries not fit for a human",
"being to behold. She motioned me",
"to a chair. We sat down. I laid",
"the packet gently on the little",
"table, and she put her hand over",
"it.... 'You knew him well,' she",
"murmured, after a moment of",
"mourning silence.",
"“'Intimacy grows quickly out",
"there,' I said. 'I knew him as",
"well as it is possible for one",
"man to know another.'",
"“'And you admired him,' she said.",
"'It was impossible to know him",
"and not to admire him. Was it?'",
"“'He was a remarkable man,' I",
"said, unsteadily. Then before the",
"appealing fixity of her gaze,",
"that seemed to watch for more",
"words on my lips, I went on, 'It",
"was impossible not to—'",
"“'Love him,' she finished",
"eagerly, silencing me into an",
"appalled dumbness. 'How true! how",
"true! But when you think that no",
"one knew him so well as I! I had",
"all his noble confidence. I knew",
"him best.'",
"“'You knew him best,' I repeated.",
"And perhaps she did. But with",
"every word spoken the room was",
"growing darker, and only her",
"forehead, smooth and white,",
"remained illumined by the",
"inextinguishable light of belief",
"and love.",
"“'You were his friend,' she went",
"on. 'His friend,' she repeated, a",
"little louder. 'You must have",
"been, if he had given you this,",
"and sent you to me. I feel I can",
"speak to you—and oh! I must",
"speak. I want you—you who have",
"heard his last words—to know I",
"have been worthy of him.... It is",
"not pride.... Yes! I am proud to",
"know I understood him better than",
"any one on earth—he told me so",
"himself. And since his mother",
"died I have had no one—no",
"one—to—to—'",
"“I listened. The darkness",
"deepened. I was not even sure",
"whether he had given me the right",
"bundle. I rather suspect he",
"wanted me to take care of another",
"batch of his papers which, after",
"his death, I saw the manager",
"examining under the lamp. And the",
"girl talked, easing her pain in",
"the certitude of my sympathy; she",
"talked as thirsty men drink. I",
"had heard that her engagement",
"with Kurtz had been disapproved",
"by her people. He wasn't rich",
"enough or something. And indeed I",
"don't know whether he had not",
"been a pauper all his life. He",
"had given me some reason to infer",
"that it was his impatience of",
"comparative poverty that drove",
"him out there.",
"“'... Who was not his friend who",
"had heard him speak once?' she",
"was saying. 'He drew men towards",
"him by what was best in them.'",
"She looked at me with intensity.",
"'It is the gift of the great,'",
"she went on, and the sound of her",
"low voice seemed to have the",
"accompaniment of all the other",
"sounds, full of mystery,",
"desolation, and sorrow, I had",
"ever heard—the ripple of the",
"river, the soughing of the trees",
"swayed by the wind, the murmurs",
"of the crowds, the faint ring of",
"incomprehensible words cried from",
"afar, the whisper of a voice",
"speaking from beyond the",
"threshold of an eternal darkness.",
"'But you have heard him! You",
"know!' she cried.",
"“'Yes, I know,' I said with",
"something like despair in my",
